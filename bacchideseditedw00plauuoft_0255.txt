a personal object. I would prefer to supply the part that is often omitted in forins of
structure in general use sc. “quod te iubeo facere id facias,” in which te is the subject
of facere, not the object. In fact, quod is the accus. case, and its governing· word must
be supplied; it is not facum, which goyerns its antecedent, but faeere, to be supplied
from facias, as has been said. Instances, however, 01 1110 1130 of such a 0030 111

the first two hundred Philips by the misrepresentations in the first letter and the inter-
vention of the soldier, the son, presuming on the good nature of the old man and on the
good opinion he 1103 formed of both himself and the 31010 from the first letter, here
boldly commences his second letter for a second two hundred to give to the sister-3 in
the first letter he made no request for money whatever. quaeso ; 300 11. 1·. 198.

995. This v. has been given to Chrysalus by all editors except Uss„ who assigns
tibi dico only to that character, and contrary to the Ms. B all give Quid est Ρ 10
the old man. Had the 31010 said tibi dico it could never 11010 called forth an expression
so abrupt and emphatic from the old man as (chz'd est? but in the mouth of the 31010
11 13 quite natural after the strong words used by the other. The whole line, with the
exception of Quid est .? is the old man’s salutation to his son after reading the first two
lines of his letter where that usual formality has been omitted. He seems 10 1110 31010
to be annoyed at this omission, but in reality his yexation arises from the request for
another two hundred Philips, and the omission gives him the excuse for expressing it ;
Chrysalus ascribes it to this, and the words of the old man and those of the slave at
end of this and in next v. clearly show that this is so. Neither of the two, Nic. nor
Chr„ what may be expected from the characters in a comedy, expresses his real feelings,
and both agree in attributing the annoyance to the same cause—the want of courtesy in
Mnes. and the general impertinence of his letter. Trans„ “A curse indeed, a great one, Ι
swear, I give you.'' Malum, &c.; the old man ends his exclamation in mockery both to
his son and the slave, using tibi dico, the last words of the latter in v. 991 ; cp. Amph.
