which in all probability we would never have possessed, had not the wholesale emenda-
tion of Terence appeared too gigantic a work even for Bentley. The “Princeps Criti-
corum ” thought he saw a way out of the difficulty by assigning a power to the ictus or
accent that it never possessed either in Greek or Latin verse, and by subordinating the
quantity of syllables in verse itself to that power. The notion was on a par with his
attempt—the ⁴· 8911119 ludibrium ingenii Bentleiani”—to restore the digamma in
Homer. We might not be far wrong, seeing that he frequently illustrates his argu-
ments by quotations from English poetry, showing the power of the accent, in tracing
this idea of Bentley to that source, for our principal poems are written in what is called
Iambic verse, scanned by accent alone.

We hope to be pardoned here for quoting a few sentences from a paper written by
a distinguished Oxford scholar, “auch Plautiner‚” who has himself edited a Comedy
of this poet, which we have recently read in the “Classical Review ’⁷ for October, 1891.
He says: “W. Meyer recently made a powerful statement of the extreme view that
absolutely no regard whatever was taken of Accentuation in Latin Poetry till a late
period . . . Klotz has pointed out the curious fact that the Greek usage for the
Iambic Trimeter, viz„ that a spondee is not allowed in the even feet of the line, takes
in the hands of the Latin Dramatists this modification, that α spondee ἰη- which metrical
‘ictus corrsiicts with natural accent is not allowed in these feet.” “Klotz shows that the
same rule is observed in Latin Trochaic lines in the metrically important feet of the
Trochaic metre, the odd feet of the line. That the Accent played a part in the early
Latin dramatic poetry which it did not in Greek poetry, may then be accepted as an
established fact.” We must, however, do the writer of this extract the justice of saying
that 119 is not without supporters in the advocacy of such a theory. We have read the
same doctrines propounded in a large volume by W. Christ, p. 335, “Metrik Der
Griechen Und Romer.'⁷ The work is mentioned here as it contains a deliverance on
the subject not yet antiquated by length of time. He says: “In der That stimmt auch
im 3ten F uss fast ausnahmslos und im 2ten grosstentheils Wortaccent und Versictus
iiberein.’' . . . “ So ergab sich daraus auch ein [ebereinstimmung des Accentes und
Ictus im 4ten und 5ten Fuss von selbst. In den F allen aber, wo gegen die Regel im
2ten und 4ten sich jene Concordanz vernachliissigt findet, ist es meistens ein jambisches‚
selten ein trochaisches Wort, dessen Accent mit dem Ictus in Widerstreit steht.''

The theory is so entirely at variance with what we have been here trying to
enforce, that a few verses have been examined for the purpose of seeing to what extent
theory and fact are in agreement. In the 40 verses of this Comedy, commencing
with verse 107, in the Senarius 20 instances in which the natural accent conflicts
with the ictus occur in the 2nd and 4th, of which 7 are Spondees. In the 59 Senary
verses commented on above, 21 instances are found in the even feet in which the
accent and ictus conflict, 11 of which are SpondeeS. Also in 40 verses, from verse 799,
there are 16 cases in 2nd and 4th feet of the Senarius in which ictus and accent do not
agree, of which 5 are Spondces, and many other instances might be cited.

In the 50 Trochaic Septenarfi, which have been examined in treating of the rule of
position, there are 32 instances in the odd feet 111 which the accent and ictus do not
agree, 15 of which are Spondees. There are 19 instances in odd feet of verses 365-404,
Septenarii, of which 10 are Spondees, in which the accent clashes with the verse ictus.
Numerous other places can be cited. Thus it appears that in Spondees, in the even
places of the Senarius, the accent and ictus agree in more cases in proportion to the
