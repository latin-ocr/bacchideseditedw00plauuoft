265. Uss. considers this v. (which all the editors, including himself, admit) spurious,
‘nam rebus ceteris' for pra ew c >tera ‘barbarum estss’ rebus ceteri& must be:
in iebus ceter-2⁶51. Ι do not think that these words can be taken with aie bat, and therefore
the meaning praet er cetera 13 out of the question, but with α (uitem in an intransitive
sense. 01331111 Ovid have ιιιῖιιίε 111 almost the same sense as here, except that it 13
generally transitive. The v. ought to be render ed,‘ ‘He 33331 ted that he w as making false
claims 111 the other particulars.⁷ eum 33. Μ113311. The host, according to the ὗ31313,
does not call Mnesil. 3 for ger in general terms; his words can only be taken as referring
to this particular case.

266. Pylades, Bothe, W„ R„ Fleck„ and Goetz have primum after 111, which W.
says 13 found 111 Β ; Uss. as in the text; cp. Most. iii. 1, 96.

267. recuperatore& commissioners, generally from three to five in number,

appointed to settle disputes between Romans and foreigners and in other cases3 cp.
Rud. v. 1, 2; Cio„ Fl. iv. 11; xx. 47, 48; xxi. 49.

269. Philippum; 333 11. vv. 217, 227.

see n. v. 125. pugnam quam uoluit dare; “the trick he wished to play’'; cp.
Pseud. 525 ; Ter.‚ Eun. V. 2, 60. The sense 13 11111311 the same in Capt. 580; Epid. iii.
4, 613 Ter., Ad. v. 3, 57.

271. Etiamne; see n. v. 125. quid, is not here an interrog. but indefin.
pronoun. This is evident from the 1133 of η’ 31111 the position of the verb3 cp Aul. 341;

accipe, trina; ασιὟ-’,ιῃιειιηα the emend. of Her‚mann 13 apt in a literal point of view.
None of the editors who have adopted it-and they have all done 30 except Weise—give
any help 111 regard to the sense supposed to 113 concealed. What 13 the meaning of the
term ?—“ hawk-weed.’' In this sense it appears to have been employed by Apuleius.
Do the editors propose to take it as fem. of accipiter or adj. from same ἱ) N 03 for there
is no authority in Latin for such a form. Hermann's emend, then, does not improve, but
rather gives no sense. Plautus applies pecuniae accipiter to an avaricious person (Pers.
iii. 3, 5). The introduction of this sentiment here would appear to sanction the 1133 of
an unrecognised form, and give an unexpected turn to the story of the slave, inconsistent
with what precedes and what follows. accipere is generally followed by an accus„ 111· 01·
ab, with abL, or by an accus. and infinit. accipe; “ observe,” is here intrans„ or an
obJ‘ect may easily be supplied; cp. Hor.‚ S. ii. 5, 10; Epid. iv. 1, 36; Τ31·.,Ρ1101·111. v. 6,
18; (113, Off. i. 33. The slave is urging this part of the story particularly on the attention
of the old man. trinam for tertia or triple r, distribut. numeral, sing„ ² agrees with pu ma,
to be supplied. All the distributives up to un 11 m with the exceptioi] ofs· 'ni and octo ni,
are occasionally 113311 111 sing. for the multiplicatives, and sometimes a distribut. in sing.
appears to be used for an 011111131; they can, of cour,se be all employed in pl. for the
cardinals. Virg. and others have centeni in sing.; Pliny( qnmqnay e'nz and s egiptum eni.
But to return to trena. Statius has‘ ‘Quae trino juvenis foro tonabasss’ and ἰ) ino re *luto
