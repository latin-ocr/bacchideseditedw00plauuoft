786. It is worth while noticing the repetitions and the quibbling with the verb

Tse. Pendebit ; either in reference to the mode of catching the thrush, or it may

sense better; that the word is found nowhere else with this meaning is unfortunate for
the explanation3 most critics have adopted it. W., however, thinks that ita . tenus
is for eatenus, which would give sense, but eam would have to be supplied for transennam,
as the object of the trans. verb intendi. In the absence of further evidence for the
former, I would myself be inclined to adopt ,the explanation of W.
