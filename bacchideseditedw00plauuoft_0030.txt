The student who may desire more information on this point than has been given here
should consult the works of these scholars. The only readings of the Palimpsest
available for this Comedy, some of which are given in the Critical Notes, belong to
vv. 473-540‚ except vv. 465, 501, 505, 508-9, 513, 518-203 553-561, 659-677, 683-696,
except vv. 685-7; 917-956, except 932-35.

The next MS. whose readings have been used in the constitution of the text of the
Bacchides is B, marked “Cain” by Taubmann and “V. G.“ (Quas Camerarii’') by
Pareus, called also the Heidelberg MS„ first collated by Camerarius, afterwards by
Parcus and Taubmann, now in the Vatican Library. This MS. has also been collated
by Ritschl and Hinckius (Hugh of Holstein). Supposed to have been written in
eleventh century, and is the best we now possess of the Comedies of Plautus. It
contains the whole twenty Comedies‚ and also the names of two—the I'idularia and
the Gaetulus—which have been lost.

(C) Codex alter camerarii, “menemus” of Paleris, because it contains only the
twelve last Comedies, from the Bacchides to the Truculentus‚ was written in the
twelfth century, and is now at Heidelberg. Has been collated by Gottholdus Gunder-
mann (Goetz). Both this MS. and Β are written in minuscle letters. There are no
marks for the characters, which in B are generally written above the verses in ink of
a different colour, nor are the verses separated, as is usually the case in the older MS.
Specimens of A, B and C are given in Ritschl’s Tri-nmnmus; and a {acsimile of the
writing in A can be seen in Weise's edition of Plautus, Tom. IV.

D (Vaticanus) was discovered in Germany by Nicolas of Treves, and brought to
Rome in 1429‚01=1430 according to Bitschl. It has been collated since the time of
Merula by Pareus, Gruter, and Augustus Mau (Goetz). Supposed to have been written
in the beginning of the fifteenth century. Now in the Vatican Library at Rome. The
MS. contains only sixteen of the Comedies, the Cas—ina, Cistellaria, Curculio, and
Epidicus· being omitted.

F (Lipsiensis), belonging to the Senatorian Library at Leipsic, also written in the
fifteenth century. Both this MS. and D contain some interpolated passages, supposed
by Ritschl to be due to Poggio Bracciolini, a learned Italian and collector of MSS. of
the first half of the fifteenth century, into whose hand the latter had come a short time
after its discovery. For a full account of this MS. see Ritschl's Opusc„ vol. ii. 1. The
foregoing MSS. are all written on parchment. In Valpy's reprint of the Delphin
edition of Plautus, edited by Operarius‚ there are critical notes given from forty-one
MSS. Ritschl, in addition to the five mentioned above, has given readings in his
critical notes on this Comedy from a large number of other MSS„ including the
Palatine‚ whose authority, when their readings do not agree with those given above,
cannot be admitted as of much weight. Goetz, who generally follows the text of
Ritschl‚ does not give the readings of the latter MSS. in his critical edition of the
Bacchides ‚· neither has the present editor given anything in the Critical Notes to that
Comedy from those MSS. But it may be stated here that the text and Critical Notes
were completed before Goetz’ edition had been examined.
