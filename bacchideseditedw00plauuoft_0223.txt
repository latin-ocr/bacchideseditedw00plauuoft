COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 163

657. Ρθοῒυες see n. v. 652. Pectus quoi sapit3 only a reassertion of what is
implied in “ frugi,” preced. v.

658. sit; subj., as in v. 652, depend. on “ ut '¹ or owing to subj. in anteced. clause.
Ut quaequomque Pes sit sc. “Ut res est, quaequomque est,⁷’ &c.; cp. Ter., And. i.
5, 28. animum habeat; asin 631. Τ116 moral principles laid down here and in five
preced. vv. are much the sanie as those of his master3 see vv. 394-400.

659. lubet; “it is desirable’'; cp. v. 981 ; Trin. 932.

660. Dempsit . . . reddidit ; these verbs and their subjects are not dependent,
not grammatically dependent, on “scire’‘ hence the indicative; the usual construction
is, of course, the subj.; see n. v. 93 cp. Ter., Eun. iv. 1, 13. ecquid of Bb has been
restored; all other editors have “quid’'; cp. v. 232; Aul„ Prol. 16. The change, in
my view, improves both meti-e and sense. Resides, if “quantum . . . . patri'' were
followed by an interrogative mark, it would remove all doubt here about the correctness

of the use of indicative; without, however, any change in the punctuation usually
adopted the sense is clear enough.

662. Deoumam partem. It was a custom amongst the ancient Romans to
devote a tenth part of their gains in trade, or of the spoils of war, to Hercules, the
guardian-god of property; cp. Stich. 233, 3863 Truc. ii. 7, 123 Cic„ N. D. iii. 36, 88;
Off. ii. 17, 58. The fact is also recorded in inscriptions, and attested by later writers,
amongst whom Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that the custom was instituted by
Hercules himself, at the altar erected to his honour by king Evander, near the Palatine
hill. Livy, however, and Virg. say that the altar was erected by the hero himself3
see Livy i. 7; Vir-g, Aen. viii. 271. abstulit; stronger than dempsit, ιῖαιημείετί, vv.
660, 668; cp. Ter., Eun. iv. 1, 13.

663. optume3 “very opportunely”; cp. Merc. i. 2, 114; ii. 2, 573 v. 2, 69; v. 4,
16; Truc. iv. 3, 78; Amph. 9503 Cas. ii. 4, 293 Ter., And. ii. 1, 35; iii. 4, 14; Heaut.
iv. 5, 9; v. 5, 2; Hec. ii. 2, 43 Eun. v. 2, 66. obviam mihist sc. obuiam mihi «it or
venit, as in Cas. ii. 6, 5 ; Merc. i. 2, 109; rare in this sense except in Plaut. and Ter.;
366 6130 Ter., And. iii. 2, 52.

664. Numqui nummi excider‘unt; “have you lost any money ’'‘? nummi ;
see n. v. 217 and 610.

665. 8103 as I see yOU. optuevffi only in Plaut.; gazing, “looking on'’; cp.
Amph. 89& Miles 1271; Most. i. 66; iii. 2, 152, 156.

666. uos sc. Mnes. and Pist. maestos , tvistisque; cp. Cio„ Orat. xxii. 74;
Mur. xxiv. 49. conspicor& as in vv. 179, 276, and cp. Ter., Heaut. i. 16; Eun. v. 8, 32.

667. temeve; see n. v. 833 nec . . , et iam quin; nec . . etiam. Quin of the
MSS„ W.‚ and Uss, is hardly Latin; Bothe, R, and Fleck. have m’c . . . Etiam quid,
which is not an improvement in the Latin, and it fails to give the sense ; et iam quin
connects this with two preceding questions, for the intervening words, Non placet, nec
temerest, is only an interlocutory remark made by the slave, from the fact. that he
has already put two questions 10 1116 young man without having received a reply, and is .
not connected with what follows. Their sorrowful appearance and their silence he says
is suspicions. The words in the text are but a slight emend, if one at all; they give
the sense, and are good Latin. May be trans, “and it is not without reason‚'' “and
why do you not reply.’' For quin in questions cp. v. 856; see n. v. 242.
