COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 161

636. Si mihi θεὴ the reading· of the MSS. lias been restored here. “sit,” the
emend. of Cameix, which has been adopted by all the editors, is indefensible, for the
reason that Si mihi sit, non pollicear caii only iiiean that if the young iiian had
anything he would not give it„a meaning inconsistent with remaiiider of v. and with
what is said in next. Pist. is quite willing to assist his friend, but the fact is clear that
he has nothing to give, as may be seen from vv. 639-40. The words at the head of this
note are a direct reply to “nihil habeo miser ’' of previous speaker, and direct object of
non pollicear, indes. relat. clause, not conditional, which requires indic.; not the
protasis of poll. which is suppressed and can be supplied sc. “etiamsi’' or “si velis
accipere.” All, whatever, or “what I have Ι would not offer.'' Mnes., “I know you
would ,qive if you had it; I am quite aware of that.’' pollicear‘; see v. 183. Scio;

637. norm retained by Bothe, W„ and Goetz.; omitted by R, Fleck„ and Uss.‚
who says that it is contrary to the sense. Why? Miies. says that if Pist. were not in
love he would not repose so much confidence in him—that is, Pist. being entangled‚ as
he supposes, and as he has lately discovered, in a love affair with Bacchis, he is sure
that he has some syinpathy with one in the same position as himself, and that he is
desirous of helping hini. This being so, the emend. has been rejected as being much
less satisfactory than the old reading. habeam tibi fidem tantam ; as in 630.
