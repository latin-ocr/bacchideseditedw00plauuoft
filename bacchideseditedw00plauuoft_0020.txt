xiv INTRODUCTION.

arguments, in which many have even up to madness, and so far, boasted. Therefore‚ let
whoever will commend Horace as a judge of Plautino style, let them praise his weighty
judginent, let them even admire it, provided Ι myself too may have permission to safely
agree with those men who seem to me, as it were, a plane tree, sufficiently spacious to
shade this place, and stretching out on all sides around with its spreading branches of
truth; as, for instance, Varro, Aelius Stilo, Macrobius, Aulus Gellius, and numerous
others of whom mention has been made above ; and that, as Ι think, rightly; for since it
is agreed that Horace was irritable, it does not appear that this judgment of his, which
he certainly uttered thus rashly from a hasty temperament, ought to be made so much
of. But I shall treat the matter in this way: Horace either did not express the truth
in this case, or he was no poet. Yes, but that Horace was a poet, Horace himself
proclaims the fact.”

(m. ii. 20; iv. 3, 6, 9, “‘But, as our Plautus reminds 113, when a poet undertakes
dramaS, he seeks for that which is nowhere to be found.' And Lucilius, that ancient
and renowned writer of Satires, has saidz—‘A painter⁷s board, nothing is real, every-
thing is seigned.’ From this it is seen that when Horatius Flaccus brought forward
this opinion he produced as assistance the absurdities of old wives. And what wonder?
For the same man, in short, gave a very absurd judgment about Laberius and
Choerilus, excellent poets before Horace. Since we read that Archelaus gave a gold
coin to Choerilus for each of his verses Of course, that which is usually said is true!

Just as King Atheas used to bind himself by a most sacred and inviolable oath (for
he swore by the North Wind and the Spear) that he preferred to listen to the neighing of a
horse rather than to the strains of Ismenias, the most renowned fiute-player of the Greeks,
(what is more absurd than this ‘?) so Romulus preferred to feed on turnips, although
the others were nourished on ambrosia and nectar. And, not inelegantly, it is wont to
be said in the proverb: ‘The ass goes past the asparagus to feed on thistles.’ On the
same principle, it seems to 1110, that judgment of the dealer in small criticism‚ a sort of
