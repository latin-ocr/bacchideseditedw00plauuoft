136 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

393. Nimim see n. vv. 71, 120. inpendiosum, has nearly the same meaning as
inpensus, v. 391, each of which has reference to the sentiment .1[(ιίι;1”αι·τ., amitti, preced. v.

394. Ι have written ΙΙΙυό here with L ss. W. ‚.,R Fleck.‚ and Goetz have retained
Illum of the Mss„ but change Ιιιι ιι· 10 laune, the emend. of Aldus. The emend. 01 Uss.
agrees better with the sense of the whole passage; and it is not improbable that Plautus
may haxe written Ιίἰιιι 01· that Illum is an old nent.

395. The reading, ιιι ι·,ιιιιι 01 1119 MSS„ Ι 11911919, 1135 been put by a transcriber for
eadem, which I have inserted in the text. L ss„ Ι 1991ῑ., 311(1 (¹ oetz haxe followed R.

opust. W. writes atque instead of aequom. After magis Pylades and Lamb. wrote
accurare atque advzssqilare, &a The emends. of Bothe and R.. are untenable; that of
Weise seems to be the best. eadem, is abl, referring to causa; esse depends on est
opus; 011111ἕίΙεῑῒοῑιιΙιιιιζιιίΙαιϊ, depends on same ; eadem implies that both the com-
plements, maglis cum cura eas-e and οἱιιιίιιῖίατιι, are applicable to est opus for the same
reason. “ Ι need to be watchful for the same reason as I need to be more careful.” For
idem used in a somewhat similar manner 599 Cic„ Brut. 84.

396. specimen specitur’; “Yon are looking at your model.'' certamen
cernitum “You are deciding the struggle.’' Observe the alliteration here, and cp.
Cas. iii. 1, 2; Most. i. 2, 43.

397. quoiquoiusmodi sc. enitescitinsmodi. Ι have written the former to preserve
uniformity in orthography, and to avoid the assumption that qu and c were interchanged
indiscriminately in the same word. It is more probable that the first part of the word
was correctly copied by the transcriber than the second, but ι]ιια 1135 119911 written for
quo with the ἰ omitted, and its separation from what follows shows that it was wrongly
taken for a different word. The us· 01 1119 genit. was often omitted in the pronunciation
which the orthography frequently followed, and here there is neither accent nor ictus 10
preserve it. Scaliger wrote cuicuimodi, and R., Fleck„ and Goetz write qzcoiquoz'modi,
omitting us of the MSS. in the second part. Lorenz and others proposed qnoiuismocli,
which must 119 101· σιιὶιιειιι’.ς·ιιιοι1ἱ; 11115 introduces a new element not found in the MSS.
and ignores qua. W. and Uss„ following Camerarius, expunge the last form, the latter
of whom would either accept this (and so in his text) or read bonusne aut quoiusmodi.
For omission of interrogative particle in double dependent questions see As. 462; Stich.
32; Ter.‚ Heaut. iv. 1, 30; and cp. such forms as velitis, ‚jubeatis in legal phraseology,
found in Cicero and Livy. Here, however, the particle is not, properly speaking, omitted;
it is not repeated, for the adjectives are strongly contrasted‚ and the order of each
successive pair being reversed, this is brought out with more force by its omission.

398. malignus3 “stingy”; cp.Ter.,Hec.i.2‚84. lar’gus; “liberat‘' comis;
“courteous''; cp. Ter.‚ Hec. v. 3, 39. incommodus; “disagreeable''; cp. Ter.‚ Hec.
i. 2, 90. Τ119 1351 15 1119 emend. of the reading of Ba by Bugge, which Uss. and
Goetz follow. W. adopts the reading of the other MSS, which is impossible. Herm.,
R., and Fleek„ without authority, write tristis before ιἰιιυιιι. There appears to be little
difference between the philosophy of Mnes. and that of the slave, 653, 119.
