188 PLAUTI BACCHIDE S.

cp. v. 974; Cure. 229; Epid. ii. 2, 111; Merc. i. 2, 903 iii. 1, 31; iv. 3, 20, 21, 23;
Pseud. 1042; Rud. ii. 3, 2; 11. 5, 21; Stich. 3703 Trin. 45; Vi1·g.,Bucol. iii. 1.
facio obsidium lli0; “ Ι ain blockading 11111111“’; just or nearly the same as “obsideo
Ilium.’' llio sc. seni, as in vv. 940, 951.

944. Nam; refers to last xz, “for against it in the same way, Ulysses was, Ι have
heard,’' 110. 11Ιί sc. Ilia, i.‹·., seni, of A and Bothe for illi<- of the other MSS„ which might
be retained as far as is required by the sense, as W. and the old editors have done. W.‚
however, has expunged itidem. itidem; in that sanie mannen cp. v. 4Ο7; Τ1·10. 1163;
Truc. i. 273 Men. v. 9, 39, 48. audacem et malum3 bold and (roguish) mischievous.

945. Dolis ego prensus sum ; Ι was surprised by niy tricks 30. tabellae.
Η1)(111” 01 Acidalius, adopted by R„ Fleck. and Goetz against both sense and metre,
cannot be admitted. l'ss. thinks that the reading Dolis 13 corrupt, and he has marked
it- in his text as being 30, although it is found in all the MSS. including A; it is found
twice, in 645, 947, and 111 960, also Cas. iii. 5, 67 below, in exactly the sanie sense as
here; it must be referred to the acts of Chrysalus. i.‹>., it is to be rendered as an abl. of
cause or instrument, not of manner; the pl. number also supports the view given. Dolis
ego and ine (Ulysses) mendicans are strongly contrasted, for both carried out their
schemes by trickery, the one by means of the tabellae and the other disguised as a
beggam cp. Ter.,And. iii. 2, 13, 29; 111. 3, 26; 111. 4, 4. pvensus, of A and USS.;
deprensus, of W.‚ R„ Fleck„ Goetz and the other MSS„ cannot be admitted owing to the
scansion, nor would it make the sense clearer than the form in the text. mendican83
for δεκτῃ 10 passage cited: as in vv. 506, 5123 cp. Ηο111.,Ο(1. iv. 244-58; Eurip.,Rhes.
503-6. paene; to be taken with interiit.

946. exquir‘it; 13 1010311301103, enquiring into. Γαΐω “the destinies.'‘ illovum;
“Iliorum’' of Gulielmius and Scaliger has been adopted by R, W.‚ Fleck. and Goetz;
apart from the met-re for which it is not required it is not in the MSS„ nor are the
Trojani often called “Ilii'’ by Latin writers3 the MSS. and Uss. have been followed.
The word here is difficult; ιιΙΙ11,” gen. sing, would be an excellent reading, but this
would do too great violence to the MSS, or “ille eorum,” in which the two pronouns
would be contrasted, and the latter being less of a demonstrative than “illorum‘’ the
reference would be understood. lbi, of course, refers to ΙΙῑυ m ; and inopum, if retained,
must stand for the people there, hominum to be supplied. Ιο fact, all Latin writers
often use demonstrative advs. and pronouns when the actions, persons or things to which
they refer are left to be supplied by the mind, for this and to avoid repetition 13 their
function. It may be remarked that-facta, which R„ Fleck. and Goetz have in their texts
for ‘⁴ fata,’' and which is found in one MS. (B), is to be rejected, seeing that “ fata '⁷ is used
again with the sanie sense in w. 948, 951, 954 ; itis 1101 their actions he is enquiring about,
but their destinies‚ in order that he may try and accomplish them, and thereby render
the fall of the city easier. This is clear from the language of the slave in the lines that
follow. sata, too, in this sense requires a gen„ and the verb exquirit shows that he
was asking the people about them. Adsimiliter’; in a similar manner; not quite the
same as η11010,” “after that manner,‘’ next v.; not often used.

947. dolis; see what is said in n. v. 945 under mendicans.

948. llio tria . . fata3 the three circumstances, the occurrence of any 000 of which
would be fatal to Troy, for its safety depended on their not occurring. N either Homer
nor Virgil mentions what these were ; the latter speaks of the fates of Troy in Aen. ii. 34.
In 946 we see that Ulysses, disguised as a beggar, is making enquiries about them.
