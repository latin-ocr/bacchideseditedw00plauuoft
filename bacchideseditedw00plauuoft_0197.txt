COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 137

401. hin03 from this place, “here''; cp. Cas. ii. 7, 13. auscultabo ; cp. v. 270.

402. Here the reading of the MSS. is retained, which Weise also has followed; cp.
Merc. iii. 4, 3. Lamb., Dousa, R, and Fleek. have aveto. Gruter proposed peracre for
cor acre; Acidalius, necne tihi acetum acre, eor being omitted3 Uss. reads ter for cor, and
says that “cor acetum esse'' is a Plautine impossibility. Plautus might have said,
“ cor aceto esse,'’ or “cor aceto est‚’' but what the learned editor means is, that he could
not say, “ cor acetum est,'’ with which I entirely agree. There is no manner of doubt
that he could say, sitne acetum . cor, the reading of the MSS„ for the verb esse does
not, except when it means “to exist,” or with an adj. or adv. referred to the subject,
or when the latter subst. is a definition ot the former, constitute complete predication.
This is seen from the fact that writers, at all periods of the literature, could not use two
Substantives with this verb, both in nom. case, unless they were almost identical in
meaning, or intended to be so; they were obliged to put the latter in the dat., by which
it aequired a different sense. What has been said applies to the pres„ fut. and imperf.
indic. of this verb, and to the imper.; but in the case of the pres. and imperf. subj.
complete predication was impossible, unless in the cases mentioned above3 hence for
these tenses the old writers often used a different verb for this purpose, viz.,fzcam‚ fuas,
fuat, &c., and-forem, f01·e.s·,f‹n·et, &a In course of time, however, some of these forms
seem to have been laid aside, when nothing remained but the forms of esse, to which the
meanings of fuam, ἄτα, still clung in the cases in which tha-t meaning could not be dis-
pensed with. In the perf. tenses ot both moods the forms of the old verb alone were in
use, and sometimes retained the old meaning and sometimes had that of a tense of esse.
sit, then,-—-fzcat “become'⁷; and whether the latter fOi’insst'zcta7·szcnz sit or fuerit, is not
important, see n. v. 154. It will be noticed that the emendd. of Gruter and Uss. given
above proceed on the assumption that sit is here a verb of complete predication, and
so it is ifzfzcat. For use of acetum see Pseud. 739, and for sentiment see Truc.
i. 2, 83-4; Aul. 460. There is no necessity to take acr‘e with acetum, as Acidalius
and W. propose; for con and pectore ep. Cas. ii. 6, 62-3; Ter.‚ Ad. iv. 4, 5 ; Phorm.
ii. 2, 7; Hec. iii. 2, 12; and for acetum see Hor., Sat. i. 7, 32.

404. Perdidit, pessum dedit; the latter is somewhat stronger. per’d.; “has
undone.'' pess. perd.; put to ruin, “ruined”; cp. Mero. v. 2, 6; Trin. 165; Ter.‚
And. i. 3, 3. uni unicum ; the only son of thee alone3 the poet is only trifling here
with two words similar in sound and meaning; cp. Cas. ii. 3, 47-8; Truc. i. 2, 97. All
editors except W. have adopted unice for uni, the emend. of Bothe3 see v. 204.

405. Eia3 see n. v. 74 ; sometimes written heia. I have followed here the ortho-
graphy of Uss.

406. illaec aetas; that, “this age.’⁷ aetem, abstr. for eoum-:illa aetate, adolescentes,

408. adsentati0; “indulgence’'

409. Nam; see n. v. 11. absque te essetzabsque te si esset,- verb always
impers. and mood subj.; cp. Capt. 74& Men. v. 7, 353 Pers. v. 2, 60; Trin. 832, 11273
Ter.‚ Hec. iv. 2, 25; Phorm. i. 4, 11; Cic.,Att. i. 19. haberem vectum; “should
have trained”:›·e.2·i.ese⁷n ‚· cp. Capt. 3673 and see n. v. 14.

410. pvauos; “depraved’⁷; in opposition to oretum: cp. Ter.‚ Heaut. iii. 1, 76.

412. tam, was not used with verbs, except as an adv. of comparison followed by
quam; here it appears to have the meaning of tantum or tantopere ,· cp. v. 774; Ter.‚
Heaut. ii. 3, 58; iii. 4. ciet; “he accuses.'' This is the explanation of W. and Uss.
