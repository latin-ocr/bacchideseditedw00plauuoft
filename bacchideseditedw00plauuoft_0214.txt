154 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

June number of the Classical Rei-ien- for 1890, gives an admirable emendation of this
line—“ Occiperes rein tute habere.’⁷ This is a repetition of haberes rem, preced. v. I would
be inclined to accept the emendation were it not that Ι cannot see that any emend. of
the MSS. is required. The line the Professor cites, Most. v. 2, 21, and . quicum eqo bibo,
quicum cdo et anm, v. 647 of this Comedy, are in favour of the readings of the MSS. And
Ι believe Plautus sometimes uses the verb conare in the sense “to engage or be engaged
in an affair of love,” or “make love'’; also “to fall in love‚’' or “be in love’' with one;
see v. 569; Cist. 119; something like cum qm'quam limares caput, v. 31, and three other
iustances cited in a note to that v. If this explanation can be accepted, then cum could be
used with amare, and the necessity for emendation obviated. Either this, assuming that
the readings of the MSS. are to be retained, or the arrangement in the text seems to me
feasible. Our verb ‘⁸ to love‘' is too vague and general to translate amare, for frequently
it means in Plautus “to show one’s love or indulge in love‚‘⁷ as when Bacchis, after she
has said “Simulato me amare,’' v. 73, says to Pist., vv. 74-5, “te uolo Me amplexari.”
me; most editors have adopted mihi, Lamb.’s emend. 1 have followed the MSS.
aud W.; F estus, the grammarian, too says that consulere in this sense was anciently
constructed with an accus.; cp. v. 681; sec Cic„ Tusc. iii. 9 end, where he defends
inri‹litst01·em of Accius; also Ter„ Phorm. v. 1, 7; Heaut. iii. 1, 28; Ad. i. 2, 47.

567. Sanun’ sc. Sanusne,- see Ter.,And. v. 4, 9.

568. Etiam; see n. v. 125. uitr'05 “without reason‘'; cp. Miles 778. prolectas
sc. lacessis, “assail‚’' which is the explanation of Lamb.; used by Cic. and Ov. in the
sense to entice; cp. Cic„ Fl. viii. 18. propr-15; “reproaches,'’ viz„ the questions put
v. 566; cp. Cio„ Att. xi. 9, 2; Fl. xx. 48.

569. Quid, amas? Bacchidem. All editors from Camer. and Scaliger have
assigned the last word to Mnes. against the reading of all the MSS„ which give it to Pist.
Does the change improve grammar or sense? Not at all, but the propensity to emenda-
tion is irresistible. Mnes., seeing that his young friend is annoyed (this is seen from the
question he puts), says, “What, are you in love’' ἱ) and the other replies, “Yes, with
Bacchis‚’' an answer which is both true and, at the same time, vindicatos his own fidelity in
the execution of the commission intrusted to him; and it also exposes the groundless
suspicions of Mnes. The latter, of course, thinks he means the sister, when the other
proceeds to the explanation contained in the next words. As regards the punctuation of
the several editors, W. has “Quid‘? amas Bacchidem”‘? R. and Fleek„ “Quid‘.) amas
Bacchidem'’; Uss. reads Quia for Quid, and entirely omits interrogative marks. erg0;
see n. v. 123. intus; see n. v. 138.

570. Quid, duas 3³ the latter emended by Pylades, Uss., and Goetz, from duae of
the MSS. and other editors; cp. Cas. iii. 5, 72; iii. 6, 19. Seyffert and Miiller are in
favour of this emend. Atque, &a ; see n. v. 84. Loqueris nugas sc. for the ordinary
nuffaris ,· “you are talking nonsense”; cp. Amph. 6203 Aul. 821 ; Cas. v. 3, 14; Curc.
604, 675; Pseud. 1081 ; Ter„ Heaut. iv. 1, 8; also n. v. 90. sciens; “on purpose”;
cp. Amph. 654; Cas. iii. 5, 56; Mero. iv. 3, 22.

571. Postremoe explanation of Uss.; “ut finem altercationi faciamus”; of
Wagner, “quid verbis opust,'’ or “ut uno verbo dicam'’ sc. denique‚· cp vv. 534, 616;
