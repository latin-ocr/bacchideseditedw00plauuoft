always “the poet'’; but the case is different in Plautus. In the Bacchides, Curculio,
Epidicus Mostellaria, Persa and Sticlmx there are no prologues, and in seven only of
the remaining plays is the poet mentioned by name3 in five of these he is always called
“ Plautus,’' so that it is only in those to the Mercator and the Asinaria that the question
of his name admits of any doubt.

Then‚ as to the emends. in the Mercator, the readings, as given above, being
“Mactici'' or “Mactiti.‘’ In our view the emend. ‘⁶ M,” that is, “ Marci Acci‚” is
better than “Macci Titi,’' that of Bitschl, for the reason that this is a clear case
of dittography3 that is, a repetition of the same syllable or letter on the part
of the copier of the MS.; also, about the time the MS. may have been copied,
ti was beginning to be assibilated; hence the c, for there is no doubt that the writer
occasionally copied by ear and not entirely by sight. Further‚ our poet is never called
by any other name than “ Plautus,” except in the two instances mentioned, in one of
which the speaker of the prologue calls him “Marcus‚'’ that is, our well-known Comic
poet whose Comedy I am bringing before you; for to say that there is any possibility
of confounding our “Marcus‚” the poet, with any other “Marcus'' is absurd and
entirely impossible. Supposing “Macius” were written, it would neither be the
characteristic, familiar, nor formal name of our poet; therefore, in giving him the
name Marcus Accius, which was only a familiar way of naming the great comedian
“Plautus,’' there would be no danger of confounding him with Lucius Accius, the
tragedian, whose formal name this is, and by which he alone is known. Attius, or
Accius, was a well-known Roman nomen. The two forms are often found. They most
probably arose from a slight change in the pronunciation, and the latter is very likely
due to that. Ussing thinks that if Plautus and Accius, the tragedian, had had the same
name, the ancient grammarians would not have failed to warn us against the confusion
of names. But the names by which the two poets were distinguished are not the same,
therefore the grammarians did not require to warn us. For the one was Plautus
and the other Accius. If Plautus was ever referred to by the ancient grammarians
or old writers under the name of Accius alone, either the context showed the poet
meant or M„ or Plautus must have fallen out, or the writers themselves were careless.
Men, even in modern times, do not always get their full name, or the same part of it,
applied to them by different writers or speakers. In fact, there was another Comic poet,
C. Plautius, mentioned by Gellius, as referred to by Varro, but our Plautus is never
called “Accius'’ or “Maccius'’ to distinguish him from the former, although they
belonged to the same class of poets. There was no danger of confounding the names,
though nearly the same 3 the more famous poet carried his far beyond the possibility of
mistake.

Ritschl persuaded himself that he saw T. Maccius written in the Milan Palimpsest;
and so, by a method of emendation that suited his purpose, he made all the forms
found in the ancient grammarians and in the MSS. of Plautus conform to this.
Maccius, M. (leuticii or n— accii titi, and Ham-utici of Varro, . . . us of Paulus, and
Accius of Festus, M. Accium Plautum (Pliny), and Accius Plautus, Fronto, and Accii
of Gellius, together with the forms Maetz'ci, Mactiti, Mam'cz', Mat-tici, Maccus, Mac-us,
and Mam-us of the MSS. are all speedily reduced to conformity. We shall only say
here that this effort of Ritschl far outstrips, in our opinion, anything that Bentley has
ever achieved in the same line. He has certainly deserved well of students of Plautus
for his many excellent works on that ancient auth0r; but we do not think this long
