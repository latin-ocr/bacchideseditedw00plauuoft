“On the other hand, we may regard as characteristic 01 Ρ10111113 1110 masterly
handling of the language and 01 1110 various Rhythms, a rare skill in adjusting and
working the situation for dramatic effect, the almost always elever and 011011 excellent
dialogue‚ and, above all, a broad and fresh humour which produces an irresistible
comic effect with its taking jokes, its rich vocabulary 01 nicknames, its whimsical
coinage 01 words, its pungent, 011011 111111110, descriptions and situations, excellencies
in which we seem to recognise the former actor '³ (Mommsen's H [story af Rome, vol. ii.‚

TITUS MACCIUS PLAUTUS.

(1) Up to the time 01 Ritschl the name 01 1110 poet was always written “Marcus
Accius Plautus;’' but in 1841 and in 1845, when he published 1113 Parerfsa, the name
as given above appeared 101· 1110 first time. Most subsequent editors 01 Plautus have
followed him more from the weight 01 1113 name than from any very strong or
convincing arguments for the change. In dictionaries and graminars, however, and
in the reprints 01 1110 editions 01 Weise, the old name is still retained. In the edition 01
Robert Stephens‚ published at Paris in 15:30, 111 1110 preface we have “Marcus Plautus,'’
and in the heading 01 1110 different plays M. Actii (for Accii) Plauti. 11 13 unfortunate
for the emend. that no instance 01 Maccius as a Roman nomen can be cited, with the
exception 01 P. Macius Verus and P. Macius Justus, father and son, quoted by Ritschl
from a Perusian inscription. He also mentions a writer 01 1111003 whose name in 301110
MSS. 01 Priscian, he says, is written “Martius,’‘ “Maccius,” “M. accius,'’ and “M.
actius.” This writer's name, who also translated the Iliad, 13 generally written
Mattius. Ussing adopts the 101111 01 1110 name proposed by this scholar, and, just as
he, would not object if an editor should prefer to write “Macula’' “Mattius,'' or
“Matius'' The Ambrosian Palimpsest 13 the chief authority relied on 101· this form.
Those who have examined it do not agree with Ritschl as to the readings; 101· 11 13 111 0
bad state 01 preservation, seeing that it is 30 0111. Geppert, who has deciphered portions
01 11, disagrees entirely with 111111; 01111 Angelo Mai, a good authority on MSS„ who
discovered it in the library at Milan, and published speciinens 01 the Comedies 110111 11
111 1815, writes “M. Accii Plauti fragmenta inedita.’' T. Vallauri also 13 against
Ritschl, and J. L. Klein, see “Geschichte des Drama,” Leipzig, 1865; so Spengel
appears to be. In the MS. B. the reading in Merc. prol. 10 13 “Mactici⁷'; also C.
and another MS. in the British Museum have ‘⁶ Mattici’⁷ as the reading 01 1110 301110
passage. In As. prol. 11 we have in B. Maccus, and in several other less important MS„
viz„ the Pal., Macus, also Macrus 13 found. At the beginning 01 1110 Amphitruo 111
several MSS. we have Planta· Asinii . . . Parcus thinks that the poet got this latter
name, that is, from asinus, 110111 1110 1001 11101 he was employed to turn the mill when
he was working 101 1113 living at Rome. Asinius is a well-known Latin proper name,
but as an adj. from asinus it 13 unknown. Others believe that Asinii here is a corruption
for Sao-simet, but this form 13 never found. Plautus, in Most. 111. 2, 83, 1103 Sarsinatis.
Whichever 01 111030 explanations may be adopted, there still remains a difficulty about
this form 01 1110 name. Ritschl, in his dissertation, “Dc Plauti Poetae Nominibus,’'
