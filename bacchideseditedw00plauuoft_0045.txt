METRES AND PROSODY. xxxix

(V. 757.) “Fugiamiis. Ch. Uos nostrum curate officium, ego ecficiam meum’';
‹Ze-ficiam, by the rule.

(6) The result of this examination is, that in 59 verses out of 584 Senarii‚ nearly
the half of the whole play, contained in this Conwdy, 69 cases have been found in
which, if we apply the rules of scansion of the Augustan period of Latin verse, the rule
of position, which alone has been considered in the verses mentioned, seems to have
been disregarded. Of these, 23 are doubled eonsonants, 4 are proper names, and in 13
the rule given at the head of the verses does not apply; 20 of these 69 seeming
violations of the rule of position occur in the even feet where, according to Bentley, the
ictus is not so elevated or striking.

Of the 50 Septenary verses noted above, out of the 365 in that metre found in this
Comedy, 52 cases have been examined in which the rule of position seems to have been
neglected. There are 7 cases of doubled consonants, 13 in which the rule mentioned
above does not apply, and 22 of them occur in the even feet of the verses.

We would have expected, from what one reads in writers on the Metres and Prosody
of Plautus and the Trochaic nature of the Latin language, to find a larger number of
these supposed shortenings in the Senarius than in the Septenarius; but if this Comedy
is to be taken as a fair specimen of them the case is quite the reverse, for 69 instances
in 584 verses would be less than i to every 8 verses, while 52 in 365 Trochaics would
be almost 1 in 7. Of course the Trochaic verses are longer, but there are no instances
in those given above of a shortening in the seventh foot.

In reference to the rule so often previously referred to, useful for the scansion of
Plautus and Terence, our conclusion is, that it is not sufficiently general, for the reason
that a large number of supposed shortenings are found which it fails to explain. It does
not state that the ictus, short syllable and shortened syllable, must all occur in the
Same foot, but this is so in those cases to which it applies. In the Senarius, according
to the rule, the shortening can only take place in the last syllable of a Dactyl and the
second of an Anapaest; and in the Septenarius on the second of au Anapwst and the
second of a Tribrach. It could be applied in the last syllable of a Tribrach in a
Senarius; but though 13 instances of shortenings have been noted above in defiance
of it, yet not a single case of shortening in this syllable is found in this Comedy. It
may be said that the Tribrach is seldom used in the Senarius. It occurs, though not so
frequently as the Daetyl and Anapaest. Five times in 40 lines examined it has been found.

It may be reasonably assumed that an equal number of so-called shorten-
ings may be found in the two metres we are examining in each of the remaining
” Comedies, therefore we would have 2400 instances of these shortenings in the Senarius
and Septenarius alone in Plautus, of which 520, a trifle less than a fourth, the rule
leaves unexplained. We are aware that Plautine scholars and editors explain away a
portion of these exceptions by the application of another rule or law—the elision of
final s, emendation, transposition, and other less plausible methods; s· final, followed
by another consonant, generally makes a syllable long by position in Plautus.
The only rule that the poet mentioned seems to have followed when writing his
Gomeflies, and his practice must be taken as the final test of all the rules formulated
by the critics of his verses, was, that when he required a short syllable, as he so
frequently did require, from the fact already noticed of his employing so many
trisyllabic feet, he managed these doubtful quantities in such a way that he was
able to prevent the ictus, or elevation of the voice of the reader or reciter, from falling
