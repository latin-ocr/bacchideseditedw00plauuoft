liv INTRODUCTION.

literature not only of Italy but of almost every country in Europe, wrote not only Latin,
but were all three diligent students of that language and literature.

Some think that after literary Latin was taken to pieces‚ so to speak, after the breaking
up of the Roman Empire‚ the loss of the litei-ary models and the dispersion of the literary
class, the several nations developed their own distinct forms of their respective languages
and their methods of accentuation in their own way until, at the revival of learning
and the invention of printing‚ when the old Latin manuscripts began to be discovered
and texts of the classics produced and printed, the old models were again available for
their guidance. For during the interval in which the several languages were in process
of formation, little worthy of the name of literature had been published. Whatever
are the facts about these Romance languages, the question of the accent in Spanish
does not even yet appear to be finally settled by grammarians and writers of that
language.

No civilized nation which has a literature and a language arrived at maturity‚
as Latin in the time of Plautus, has ever taken the ordinary pronunciation of the
common people as the standard. If it is maintained that Plautus did so, then he did
what no other writer in any fully developed language ever did. But seeing that the
Romans have been called a nation of grammarians, and that Latin grammar was almost
one of the exact sciences, it is not possible that the poet mentioned ever did adopt such a
standard of accentuation or pronunciation in his verses, even on the supposition that
it differed to any great extent from that of literary Latin, which, as has been stated
above, has not yet been proved.
