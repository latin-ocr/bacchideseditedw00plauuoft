COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 179

redress in the courts of crimina] law3 cp. Hor., Sat. ii. 7, 60-3. It may be mentioned
that though a concubina might have obtained the rights of a uror, a meretrla· never
could, for there is the same differenee between the two Latin words as is between their
English equivalentS, “ concubine'' and “harlot''; the former is never applied in this
play to the sister ; she is always »zeretrix or mnlier; but 599 Mero. iv. 4, 17.

856. Audin sc. Audi-sne. Quin ; see n. v. 667.

857. Per-ii ; see n. v. 278. misem as in vv. 635, 831, 848, 1090, 1098, 1103—4;
Amph. 1055 ; Cas. ii. 3, 21, 60; ii. 6, 51; 111. 2, 19, 28; iii. 5, 2, 63, 65; iv. 3, 16.

858. Tum ; in reference to what 119 says in v. 855. quae c. ρ. u. ; can only be
said of a meretrix, and is altogether inconsistent with what he says in v. 838, where he
tries to make it appear that she is his wife; see 11. v. 855 above, and cp. Frag. Amp. 6
(Nonius).

859. Faxo; ut omitted with subj.; see n. v. 750; Τ91·., Ad. ii. 2, 1. Wagner is
mistaken when he says, in a note on Ter., Ad. v. 3, 62, that “only here and Amph.
972 (2³) do we find ιΤίωυ followed by the subj. instead of the fut. ind.,'' for in his own

edition of Terence the same construction is found in the other passage cited above.
With the whole v. cp. v. 503.

860. paulula pecunia; “for a trifling sum of money.‘’

861. ergo, with imper.; cp. As. 324, 916; Cas. ii. 4, 83 iii. 3, 25; iii. 6, 29 ; iv. 2,

qu'cild' .· iubgigsssc. quidluhet, of MSS„ Weise and Lind., has been retained, for we have

863. Phiiippi; see n. v. 217 911(1 227.

864. iam; see n. v. 45. animam3 breath of life; see n. v. 12. uitae (v. 844),
mode of life. eXSOPbeb0; Iam esse istanc exsorbeb&tristitiam cibi (S. Turpilius, Leucadia);
much the same as absorbet, v. 468. oppido ; see n. v. 848. With this whole v. cp. 844.

865. The MSS. and Uss. have been followed here in giving Em, . . . potes
to Chrysalus. Em; see n. v. 206. 11100 01· 1’Ζίι(σ;ιῗίἰ1ιιί,· accus.; see n. on «ῖετιιε, v.
73, 01· 11 may be abl. sc. stlocum, as in 860; in the former case it refers to ducenti Ph„
in the latter to the miles. pacisci, here, next v.‚ and 861 appears to be trans, in 860
intrans„ or here intrans. if illoc is taken as abl. si, has been variously emended by
different editors, on the plea that Si potes does not agree well with what the slave
says in v. 860; why this is supposed to be the case does not appear. The slave tells
the old man in 860 11191 119 can come to terms with the soldier for 9 5111911 511111, 11111
when the last mentions the sum required to be paid‚ he thinks the old man is alarnied
at the amount, which he has now heard of for the first time, and 50 119 changes his
language somewhat‚ in order to tone down a little what appears to 119 1119 exorbitant
demand of the soldier. See here, come to terms with him if you can, or make an
agreement with him on that sc. ducenti Philippi if you can (taking illoc as an accus.).
Either trans. gives good sense, and appears to be not only not inconsistent with preced-
ing, but entirely consistent. obsecr’0; see n. v. 99.

866. sedulo sc. (sine-dolo) ἀδόλως honestly, diligently, carefully; cp. vv. 472,
