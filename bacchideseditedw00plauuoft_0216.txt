156 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

f01·1n; for other instanees see Capt. 630; Cas. i. 15; Cure. 244; Men. ii. 3, 92;
Merc. i. 753 iv. 4, 16; Most. iii. 2, 1653 Poen. i. 323 Rud. iv. 4, 126. The
word is not found in any other writer except in a fragment of Varro. Whatever
may be its derivationi, it is worth while to notice that it is nearly always addressed to
slaves—only once to a girl and once to an old man—and that it is used by slaves and
parasitos, except in three or four instances. It is accompanied with an imperat.
mood except in three cases—Capt. 630; Cure. 244, and Men'. ii. 3, 92. We have it
in four forms: five times “dierectus,’' four “dierecte,” twice “dierectum‚” Capt.
above and Meir, in the former of which, if an adj„ it would agree with “ cor,’' and in
the latter with “lembum,’‘ and twice “dierecta,” in one of which (Rud. iv. 4, 126) a.
girl is addressed, in the other (Most. iii. 2, 165) a dog, which may be fem.‚ is spoken to.
Not only the derivation of the word, but also its scansion in Plautus, as has been said,
has not yet been determined. Some of our best scholars, among whom may be
mentioned, in addition to those given above, Professors N ettleship, Palmer, Sonnenschein,
Seyffert, and the late Mr. Onions, have tried their skill on it. They seem to be about
equally divided in their opinions. 111 six cases, I would say, the word cannot be
scanned as a ‹piadrisyllable with first long without emendation—these are Capt. 630,
Trin. 457, Most. iii. 2, 165, Rud. iv. 4, 126, Poen. i. 2, 137, Cure. 244. All may be
scanned by taking the word as a trisyllable, except Men. ii. 3, 92. The texts examined
are those of Weise, Ramsay, Sonnenschein‚ Ussing, and Brix. propudium ; “ wretch’';
cp. Cure. 190; Poen. i. 2, 63.

581. panem tris pedes laturum “bread three feet broad.” Uss. quotes from
the Moretum of virgil, “Levat opus palmisque suum dilatat in orbem, Et notat
impressis aequo discrimine quadris.'⁷ Seneca has “quadra panis.'’ U ss, also refers the
student to Mart. ix. 91, 18, and Virg. vii. 109. None of these passages warrants the
expression in the text, which is only explicable on the ground that the parasite is in a
passion, and, when railing at the puer, exaggerates in regard to the dimensions of the
bread he was in the habit of devouring3 cp. Ter., Eun. v. 4, 17.

582. pulsan& has been put for pultare of the MSS. and editors to preserve
uniformity in orthography; see n. v. 579. Ecquis, &c.; Scaliger and Subsequent
editors have omitted his of the MSS„ and all editors with Z, whose authority Ι have
here followed, have given these and following words to the parasite instead of the puer.

583. Heus; see v. 324. ecquis . . . ecquis; preced. n.

584. Ecquis; Ecqui, R.'s emend, adopted by Fleck. and Uss., is quite un-
necessary. istum see n. v. 73. pulsatio; cp. Truc. ii. 2, 3. In reference to the
forms puls· and pult· here and vv. 579, 580, 582, W. is the only editor who always
consistently writes the same form, the latter, whereas others have sometimes the one
and sometimes the other, just as they are found in the MSS„ or as an orthographical
anomaly of this description gains their sanction.

585. Qui? quae. I am loath to adopt here W.’s explanation that the final
syllable of mala is long ; Uss.’s‚ that Pol has been omitted, 1 think also inadmissible3
neither can Quid ‚³ quae, the emend. of R. and F1eck., be accepted. I ought to have
said that W. also has quae. Ι have merely supplied quae from R„ Fleok„ Geppert,
and Goetz, which very likely has been omitted after Qui ; see n. v. 51. quae mala
cr'ux agitat ; “ what the devil ails you’' ξ) cp. Aul. 623 ; also see Aul. 514 ; Cas. ii. 6, 64.

586. extentes; “ exert”; also in Most. iii. 1, 60.
