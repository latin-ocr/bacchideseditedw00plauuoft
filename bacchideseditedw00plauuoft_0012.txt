vi PREFACE.

whatever Pareus‘ methods of criticisin may have been, his views of the merits‘ of
Plautus as a Comie poet are so far in accord with those of the present editor that that
old scholar and other eritics on that subject have been quoted somewhat fully in the
Introduction. This has been done principally with the view of drawing the student’s
attention to the excellencies and defects of this poet, and to strive to remove some of
the objections that are sometimes put forward against the reading of his Comedies.

The references in the Notes are, for the Amphitruo, to the text of Ussing; for
the Asinam and Cat-calio, Ussing and Fleckeisen; Stichus and Psezalulus, Fleckeisen;
Aulularia and Trinammas, Wagner; and sometimes Bitschl’s text was used for latter,
and Ussing’s for former; Captivi, Ussing and Sonnenschein; Miles Gloriosus, generally
Tyrrell, and sometimes Ritsch13 Mostellaria, generally Ramsay. In all the remaining
Comedies the references are to the text of Weise. These texts are generally in the
hands of students of Plautus. It is disticult to refer students to a single, and at the
same time a good, text for all the Comedies3 Ussing’s is, of course, to be preferred; but
his later volumes were not out when some of the Notes to this Comedy were written.

The Editor can say that there are few lines in Plautus that have not been examined;
he has read nearly all that has been written on the Comedies of that poet. Peculiarities
in structure or grammar, not exclusively Plautine, have also been noted. Instances of
particular words have been collected in which there may be sometimes a slight difference
in meaning from that of the word under discussion, but where there is any material
differencc it has been noted. The object has been to compare as many words and
phrases as possible. and in this way to gain a fair knowledge of the other Comedies by
the reading of one.

The edition has not been prepared for any special class of students, programme or
examination; but the Editor will be well pleased if it is found useful to students who
may have to read Plautus for an examination. It is believed that no point which a
student of this poet ought to know has been passed over in the Introduction and the
Notes. There is another class, neither students nor teachers of Latin, who may wish to
renew their acquaintance with the old poets, and whose interests, it is hoped‚ have not
been overlooked.

If a better edition is produced, and he is very far from thinking that that would be
a difficult undertaking, no one will be better pleased than the Editor himself. It is
the want of an English edition of any sort that has suggested the work. Meantime, Si
melius quid habes arcesse ‘rel imperium fer.
