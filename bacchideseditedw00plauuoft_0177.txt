COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 117

248. cor· mi et cevebr‘um sc. feeling and understanding; com see n. v. 623

(viv-it? cer'. cp. Hor.,S. ii. 3, 75. The words cor‘ . . . cen. . . . fin. imply sorrow and
13 ress.

249. ubi. quaque sc. ubiquaque, a form found in Apul. de Mund. ,· the poet
Manilius has quiaque. This is the reading of the MSS„ which W. and Uss. follow;
quomque, the emend. of Lamb., which R. and F leck. adopt, is inadmissible in the face of
all the MSS. It refers to place, but may be rendered ‘⁶ whenever’'; see Most. iii. 2, 79.

250. There is a pun here on hospitem, hostem.

251. Quid ita; see n. v. 85. obsecr‘0; see n. v. 99. he90133 see n. v. 208.
edepol ; see n. vv. 35, 157. cer’t0; “for certain,” found only in Cic. and the Comic
poets; cp. vv. 434, 1101, 11263 Amph. 707, 1015; Miles 2733 Stich. 88; Men. ii. 3,
273 Cas. 55; ii. 6, 3; Epid. i. 44.

252. Uola, Sol, Luna; Camer., Lamb., and Bothe propose to insert et here after
Lmza; Guyet transposes and reads Εἴ, Luna, Sol, which all the editors except Weise
have adopted3 W. thinks that the final vowel of Luna is long, but this is open to doubt,
and even if he were correct the verse is bad. Independent of the fact that transposition
is the most objectionable method of emendation, it here breaks the sense, for the natural
order of ideas would be expressed as the words stand in the text. dii ; R„ Fleck„ and
Uss. have dc· ,· Weise and Groetz, clei. Dii, nom. pl., and diis, dat. or abl. pl., are not,
of course, Plautine forms of deus, but the first of these is not here, 1 believe, a form of
deus at all, but of dius, an old nom., which we have in medius fidius* ,· cp. Cic., Fam. v.
21 ; Sall., Cat. 35 ; and dii itself, I think, in Livy viii. 9 ; Yirg. also has sul) dio (subst.)
or dico,- Georg. iii. 435, also Varro, L. L. vii. 3, 88. It is employed by Lucret. i. 22, ii.
172, v. 1387, Virg.‚ Aen. xi. 657, Hor., Sat. i. 2, 32, and Ovid as an adj.:dirinus or ‹liz-ux.
diei of the MSS. might, it must be admitted, be a blunder of a copyist, the «li being
repeated from ‹li-es, so that the correct reading would be dei, a legitimate form ; but even
were this granted, the v. cannot be scanned without some further change. We know by an
examination of inscriptions that the ancients generally wrote ei for ι’ long, hence diez· may
be after all a genuine old Latin form. Bothe proposed diui. It is no objection to the
explanation of clii given here that Plautus does not use it elsewhere, for many words occur
in his comedies not to be found in any other writer, and several instances of words used
only once or twice by himself might be cited. To call Dses a god is, however, quite unusual,
unless it may be, perhaps, a translation of the Greek Heium-a ; but see Cio„ N. D. iii. 17, 44.

253. inluxere (inlucescere); trans, cp. Amph. 543.
255. Quid non feoi's ἒ) “What has he failed to do'' ἱ) quin ; see n. v. 242.

256. Pr‘imumdum; “first of all, then'’; cp. Most. i. 2, 37; ii. 1, 53; Miles
297; Trin. 98. infitias ir‘e; Plautus has also Onmia infitias ire, Cist. iv. 1, 2, 9;
cp. Pseud. 1086; Men. ii. 3, 5ος v. 8, 8; Miles 180; Most. iv. 4, 29; Liv. vi. 40.
The phrase is generally connected closely with another negative3 less emphatic
than maflare. The accus. is to be explained on the same principle as domum, rus, Rc,
after verbs in which motion is expressed or implied. It is worth observing how cleverly
the slave imposes his story on the old man, varying· his language in narrating the
several incidents, and so impressing his hearer with the firm belief that he is relatlng
to him almost word for word what actually occurred. Coepit,- Infit, v. 2623 infitias ire:
