asinis licebat hoc discrimen discere qui rudentes corripiunt acutam uocem, imam pro-
ducunt.'' ‘⁴ Sunt quidam adeo crassi ut non distinguunt accentum a quantitate, quam sit
longe diuersa ratio,'' he says, “A very slight elocutionary culture would put a stop to such
vain talk (th rain talh- beina τι) lengltlzen (ι syllable haring] tlte arcent! .· but we have,
unfortunately, too many scholars who gather their crude notions on such subjects from ·
a few phrases current in the schools, without ever questioning their own ears, the only
proper witness of what is right or wrong in the matter of enunciation. Hence the
cumbrous mass of erudite nonsense on accent and quantity under which our library
shelves groan; hence the host of imaginary difficulties and impossibilities that birch-
bearing men will raise when you tell them to perform the simplest act of perception of
which an unsophisticated human ear is capable.'⁷ Quantity without accent were a
monotonous drivel of dreary sing-song; accent without quantity can be likened only to
a series of sharp parallel ridges, with steep narrow ravines interspersed, but without
the amplitude of grassy slope‚'’ &c (Blackie‚ Pronnaeiatimz ‹gf Greek· ).

Whatever errors Plautus has committed in the matter of Hiatus, shortening of
long and lengthening of short vowels, are nearly all to bc found in the Epic poets, Greek
and Latin, whose compositions one would expect to find the most correct. We must
never forget that Plautus was engaged in the composition of Comedies in which more
freedom is allowed than in Epic poetry. It was in the shortening occasionally of a
vowel long by position, only, that he differs from other poets—we mean those of the
Augustan period, to the rules of whose poetry in this matter it is, under some theory
of accentuation, extremely absurd to endeavour to reduce his verses. The reason for
this difference has been given in the preceding· chapter. Can it be proved that any Latin
poet before Plautus followed the rule of position in their poetry with the same strictness
as the Augustan poets i> This cannot be (lone. It can be easily shown that many poets,
and especially Terence after him, followed his practice, and did not conform to the
Greek rule of position.

We need not tire the patience of our readers here with quotations from modern
scholars on this matter, with whose arguments we are unable to agree, except in so
far as their views have been only recently expounded or have not been noticed by others.
As to the Latin grammarians, their views have been cited. discussed, and criticised by
Plautine scholars over and over again. The degree of credence to be placed in theories
of accentuation in the Latin Comic poets is invariably to be measured by the number
of changes to which the texts of these poets are forced to submit3 for without such
changes they have no existence in fact.

It has been stated above that until it 0111 be shown that the ancient Latins carried
on their ordinary conversation in verse, any attempt to prove that their verses were
recited in the same way must end in failure. And this is exactly what Mr. Lindsay—
and we mention his name with all due respect, since hc is doing his best to advance the
cause of classical learning—has done in his paper in the “Classical Review'' for
November, 1892. Reviewing a book of Dr. Franz Skutsch, he says, “We find scattered
up and down the pages a more or less defined theory of the versification of Plautus,
namely, that it reflected in a singularly close degree the actual pronunciation of
colloquial Latin in Plautus’ own time, and that, although it was in its essence
quantitative, being an imitation of the quantitative metre of the Greeks, it kept as far
as was possible the metrical ictus in unison with the natural accentuation of every-day
speech; so that, if we read aloud a line of Plautus with regard to the metrical beat of
