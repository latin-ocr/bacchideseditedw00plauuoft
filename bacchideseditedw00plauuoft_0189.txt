COMMENTARY AND . NOTES. 129

Trin. 720. solum; “sola'' Uss.‚ to show that what the slave mentions here was
not altogether unknown to the ancients, quotes Pliny, the Elder, “Hagnonem Teium,
Alexandri magni praefectum, aureis clavis suffigere crepidas solitum esse,'' and Valerius
Maximus, “Antiochi caecam et amentem luxuriam exercitus imitatus magna ex parte
aureos clavos crepidis subiectos habuit.'’

330. fastidit; “Why is he so proud'’‘.) cp. Curc. 632; Cas. iii. 6, 12; Μο51. iv. 1,
28. ita; refers to the preceding words of Chrys„ and this and following sentence are
logically connected by tantas, which contains ita repeated; but otherwise, and as far
as grammar is concerned, they are quite independent of each other. There is also a
change 01 speakers. If any grammatica] connection were required here it would be made
by quiem see vv. 85, 100, 251 ; Cure. 48. ut, as a relative to ita, would be either com-
parative or consecutive, and would entirely destroy the sense intended.

verb; not a subordinate depen. on ut, to be supplied; as perf. subjunctive it could be
used only after a present indic. ‹luitzdea the emend. of Herm„ R„ and Fleck„ would
mean “I could wish that he will give it to 1110,” 111 which both velim and duit would
indicate indefinite future time; the 5110511013110110101,(5101111051Ζο5 and defines the time

perf. part. for the 1011)( ‘will' ’zhe has willed to gine: he will haze gix en. This arises
from the fact that we can only use‘ ‘will’' and“ 11 ould' in the formation of the future,
and that “willed‚⁷’ participle and past tense, cannot be employed for this purpose; the
action is assumed “as good as done. ’⁷ If ι· ‘lim were rendered “I shall wish, ’⁷ d ›dm-it
