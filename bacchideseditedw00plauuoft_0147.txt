COMMENTARY AND NoTES. 87

called cupido “immoderate love’'; cp. Curc. 3; Nonius that “cupido and amm·
appear to have the same meaning, but'’ that “there is a difference, for cupido is the
result of the inconsiderate force of circumstances, amm· of judgment.'’ But cupido is
for the most part constructed with an object in genitive, except it be here taken in the
sense of cupiditas. Ι think it is rather the proper name Cupid‚ as in Cure. 33 see
ΤΙ-111. 673; 3130 Amph. 833. The meaning is, “Has Cupid or love unnerved thee '’ ἱ)
annezam see n. v. 577; Cas. iii. 1.

19-20. Τ119 sister addresses Bacchis. Ritschl has arranged these fragments in
such a way in his edition of Plautus containing the Baecltz'des that, though he recognises
the sister as one of the characters in the different soenes, he does not introduce her as
a speaker in any of them. He gives these and the following lines to Bacchis, but this
character generally speaks 111 iambics. “My heart, my hope, my honey, sweetness,
food, delight.'’ The last three terms are only an extensior] and a sort of climax of the
last of the first three ; and in apposition to it, otherwise, Ι think the pronoun would have
been continued; cp. for the words used v. 11993 Poen. i. 2, 155-7, 173; 01110. 164;
Most. i. 4, 12; Stich. 740; Trin. 244; Cas. i. 47-50. ‘⁶ suauitudo-——suauicas '’
(Nonius) ; 'cp. Stich. 755.

21. Sine te amem; “Let me love thee’'; sino is used by Plautus (1) with
infin„ (2) with subjunc. with ut omitted, (3) absolutely or with aoeusative; cp. (1) vv.
144, 172, 399, 416, 1036, 1124, 1169; Cas. 493 ii. 3, 45, 833 iii. 5, 44, 60; 111. 6, 38;
iv. 3, 16; v. 3, 22, 31, 53; Most. i. 4, 153 Trin. 521, 628-9, 11673 Poen. i. 2, 63;
Pseud. 1222, 1302; Amph. 428, 4493 Cure. 109, 208, 11053 Truc. ii. 7, 773 iv. 2,
25-6, 44; (2) vv. 1023, 1132, 1176, 1201; 033. 1. 2, 27; ii. 2, 33; 11. 8, 1; Poen. i. 1,
14, 18; i. 2, 166; Most. i. 1, 10; (3) vv. 97, 806, 1125& Pseud. 61, 62, 159, 239, 477,
839, 861; Cas. i. 483 iii. 2, 14; b'tich. 953 Cure. 655; Aul. 417, 900; Α3. 893;
Most. ii. 1, 5-6; V. 2, 34; v. 3, 53, 53; Amph. 799.

22-23. R. gives these lines to Pistoclerus. The sister appears to be giving Bacchis
an account of the threats and cruelty of the soldier. Uincla, uir'gae3 the force and
effect of the words are strengthened by alliteration ; Uincla is a general term. if any
particular kind of punishment is implied by this word, it must refer to the manicae or
pedicae with which slaves were often bound by their masters and sent to the mills or
prisons on their estates. The punishment of scourging with τιή-μαι· was also employed.
No Roman citizen could be punished 111 this way, even by the governinent, but masters
had the power of life and death over their own households, which included slaves and
free-born. The soldier had some such authority as this over the sister, who had been
engaged by him for a year at a fixed sum. For rimae see vv. 362, 775 ; As. 262, 338,
5683 Capt. 650; Epid. i. 1, 26, 94; Rud. iii. 2, 22; 111. 4, 27, 53; Curc. 193; Cas.
ii. 6, 48; Μ911. v. 5, 40. For molae see Pers. i. 1, 22; Pseud. 1100; Poen. v. 3,
38, 866. “ saeuitudo for scwm'tia’' (Nonius).

24. R. gives this and three following lines to a slave. This line appears to be the
continuation of the sister's description of the soldier. Latronerrn “the ancients
Called those WhO served fol· hire latrones α’»πό τῆς λατρείας ” (Festus) ; “hired soldiers
are called latrones'' (Servius); and this seems to have been the original signification
of the word; see Curc. 5483 Miles 74, 9493 Stich. 135; Poen. iii. 3, 50, 53.
venditat; cp. Miles 312; Curc. 482.
