COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 115

his master’s affairs, in which we see he is well versed ; he knows about the sister, and of
the letter having been sent to Pist. to try to find her; and on his arrival in Athens he
wishes to avoid the old man, lest he should be obliged to make any disclosures about the
gold before meeting with Pisa, so that there can be no doubt that he knew of the
existence of the soldier and of his claim on the sister. This being so, his question, as
the editors put it, is quite unnecessary and gratuitous, if not absurd. With the reading
of the text cp. Cic„ Cat. i. 3, Rab. 8, Agr. ii. 31 ; ovid, Met. ii. 179; also Ter„ Heaut.
v. 2, 24. Trans„ “For a soldier will arrive here directly, and a soldier indeed, who
demands gold for giving up Bacchis’'; see also Madv„ G. L. 484 c n.q.

h 222.BBotfk1le has ltine em‘yet here. hic, as lznc in preced. v., refers of course to the
ouse o acc is.

221. atque ita3 Ι am not sure that the correct reading here was not itaque,
which Plautus often uses in the sense of ita alone, ‘⁶ so⁷³ or “thus’'; it would improve
both sense and metre, but as I have no authority on the point Ι ain unwilling to make
the change. [l‘he reading of the text can, however. I believe, be defended. Atque ita is
almostzin meaning to itaque in lat-er writers, “and so⁷'; ita refers to the preceding
words. ne Sit, as renim, is for an imper. The slave says, “Let him come when he
wishes, and so he can cause no delay to me; the gold is ready.’'

’ 222. Domi est, (numm) subject of esu cp. vv. 362, 648; Amph. 631; Cas. ii. 3,
8; Cist. ii. 1, 23 Curc. 681; Mero. ii. 3, 203 Miles 194-5. Ι have adopted the reading
in the text, which is that of the MSS„ except that B appears to have domi st, to avoid
the admission of mila& after memo, R.'s emendation, or »neque eyn, that of Bothe, neither
of which can be defended.

223. Dum; “as long as '’; cp. Tmo. ii. 1, 23; Rud. ii. 6, 74. This word is an
old accus, diu is the abl. form, we have also dmm, and is probably for dium, from same
root as divus, dies. per‘fidia (petfizI113): cp. perjurium (perjuras), pereo, perd0‚peri7110, in
all of which, contrary to the general usage of per in the composition of Latin words, the
meaning of the uncompounded form is entirely changed.

224. ἰηῒνο; see n. v. 103. curalo03 this verb is generally constructed with
accus. or dat.‚ or followed by subj. with or without ut: here it is intrans.; cp. v. 688-9;
Aul. 355; Capt. 125; San„ Cat. 59, Jug. 46, 57, 6Ο, 99. intus; see n. v. 138.

226. au varium ; is not, as far as I know, used elsewhere by Plautus.

227. Philippo& Philippum, the emend. of Bothe, is much less satisfactory than
tulimus, that of R„ which I have adopted. Supposing the objection of Uss., who follows
Bothe, that the latter is not a Plautine form (see Cure. 643), is correct, I would not hesitate
to read tendi, which R.’s views of the metre prevented him from adopting, in preference to
Philippum. F leck., of course, follows R.; Goetz follows Bothe; W. makes no change,
but the v. in his text cannot be scanned at all; see n. v. 2173 and cp. vv. 269. 591,
863, 874, 877, 914, 929, 964, 993, 1007, 1022, 1046, 1188; Miles 1064; Trin. 959, 965,
1158; Poen. i. 3, 6; iii. 2, 22; iii. 3, 57; iii. 5, 26, 363 Hor., E. ii. 1, 234.

229. lnde; here, cannot apply to time or place, and must, therefore, refer to
Philippos, and this reference will be sufficiently indicated by “ thence”; cp. Amph. 425;

Miles 711; Ter„ Ad. 1. 1, 22; Phorm. iv. 3, 76. al. mach. machinam3 “I shall
devise some scheme’'; machinor is found in Lucret., Cic., Sall„ and Livy in this sense;

cp. also Cas. ii. 3, 61; ii. 4, 22.
