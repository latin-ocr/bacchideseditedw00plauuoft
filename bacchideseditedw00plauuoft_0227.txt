COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 167

699. Enim; affirmative or asseverative, with much the same force as in v. 48 and
passages cited in note to that v.; cp. also v. 454; Cas. ii. 3, 52; 11. 4, 2; ii. 5, 15; ii.

It will be seen by an examination 01 111030 passages that the rule that enim cannot stand
the first word in a clause does not hold good as far as it may be applied to the comedies
of Plautus. In 14 of the passages cited it does not hold. I cannot admit that enim
here and in the passages cited abovezemmrero in Plautus, as is the opinion of KVeise,
XVagner, Key, Ussing, &c Ramsay has shown in his note on the word (Most. p. 206)
that this is not the case, for the latter is much stronger. nisi3 see 11. v. 321. nisi

704. Tum nobis opus est sumptu; W. and Bothe, who have been followed
here, give these words to Pist.; other editors have assigned them to Mnes.; but this
character does not throughout this 300110, except in 117. 717 and 756, where the sense is
not very clear, use a pronoun in first pers. pl. or verb in first pl., for the only interests
he is concerned about are his own, whereas Chrysalus, who appears to be general
manager and chief director 01 1110 business, addresses both 01 1110 young men in vv.
666-7, 699-700, 709, 749-54, 756 ; and in 705 first pers. pl. is found. Pist., too, though
not so deeply involved as his friend, whose commission he has successfully executed. is
entitled to speak, and drops in a word or two occasionally, and perhaps thinks that
Chrysalus may do something for him also on account of his great services; he uses
here first pers. pl.‚ as in 699, 710. Apart from his connexion with Bacchis, he and
the slave seem to be on the best of terms, and are entirely agreed about getting the
money; he is sent by the latter for the writing materials; his language often chimes
in with that of the slave, which it closely resembles in the vv. cited, if not in sense, at
least in the form of expression. Tum ; 311000331011 111 111110, “after that‚'' may refer to
another adv. of time, as in 516 and next v., or it may not. It merely here takes up the
next point in the dialogue, the next after Ego dabo. opus est ; strongly in favour
01 the words being given to Pist., as has just been stated, as there 13 110 reason why
Mnes., if they be given to him, should change the form of expression that Chrysalus
and he himself have already made use of for the one in the text, which would be quite
natural and correct in a new speaker. sumptu ; cp. Miles 672-3; Most. i. 2, 21, 41-2 ;

with ut omitted; see n. v. 689.

705. istuc; see n. v. 733 may refer to what has been said in last v., and hoc to
the v. that precedes it, or each pronoun may only indicate a different point of view of
the order of the business in the mind 01 1110 slave.
