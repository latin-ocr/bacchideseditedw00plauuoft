COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 125

the proper name, and a dactyl in fifth place occurs frequently; see vv. 288, 291 ; also
next v. No editor except W„ who follows Pareus, proposes to remove the hiatus in
next v. by inserting in before Dianae, or adopts deae Dianae est, the emend. of Muller.
Why ἱ) Because it is difficult to reconcile the changes proposed with the readings of the
MSS.; but this is no answer if emendation be required. Believing‚ therefore, that Acid.
has been too implicitly followed in this instance, and that emendation is not required, I
have ventured to restore the MS. readings, the genuineness of which I can see no
reason to doubt.

things of great value in their temples, believing that the sanctity of the place would insure
their safety, is well known; they themselves even in times of danger often betook
themselves thither to escape the vengeance of their enemies3 cp. Caes„ Bell. Civ. iii.
33, 105; Nepos, Hann. ix. 3. When the Gauls took Rome, we read that the senators
withdrew to the Capitol, the sacred habitation of the Roman divinities. The modern
custom of depositing the dead in and around Christian temples seems to have had a
similar origin. The slave says they deposited the gold with Theotimus, who was the
priest of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. On the points here noticed the student is
referred to Cic„ Leg. ii. 16, 40-13 Att. v. 21; Fam. v. 203 Caes. B. Civ i. 63 Corn.
Nep„ Hann. 9. Lambinus quotes a passage from Chrysostoinus explaining the custom,
”Iove που τους Εφε σιους, ὅτι πολὶα χρίματα παρ scm-015 ἐστι τα μὲνι ἰδιωτῶν »im κε ίμε 1:112
ἐν τῷ νεῷ τῆς Ἀρτέμιδος, οὐκ 'EQ σιων μόνον, dm. a ζέ νων καὶ τῶν (πόθε ν οηποτΞ ivOpa'nwv,
τοὶ δὲ καὶ δήμων nai βασιλέων, ἃ τιθέασι πάντες οἶ τιθέντες ἀσφαλείας χάριν, οὐδενος
οὐδεπώποτε τολμήσαντος α’δικῆσαι τὸν τόπον, καί τοι καὶ πολέμων ἤδη μυρίων γεγονότων καὶ
πολλάκις ἁλούσης τῆς πόλεως. Megalobuli3 the priests of the temple of Diana at
Ephesus were the “Μεγκ’βυζοι”; see Xen., Anab. v. 3, 63 Diog.‚ Laert. ii. 51. Photius
quotes from the Δὶς ἐξαπατῶντι of Menander, from which Plautus is supposed to have
derived part of his materials for this comedy,

οὐ Μεγάβυζος ἦν
’ὅστις ’γένοιτο ζάκορος,

where the name probably refers to the same ; cp. Lucian‚ Tim. p. 7. Chrysalus wished
to mislead the old man about the money; for, while desiring to get him away from
Athens, he had no intention whatever of letting him know that all the gold was deposited
with his son, Mnesilochus, the priest of the temple of Bacchis and the sister. Theotimus
was a name invented by himself. “ Who is this Theotimus'' ἰ) N obody had ever heard
of him; and to work still further on the credulity of the old man he replies that he is
the son of Megalobulus‚ puns and makes game of him to his face, for he intends the
name to apply both to Nicobulus himself and to Megabusus, the real priest of the temple ;
but Megabusus was, according to Strabo, a eunuch3 see xiv. 1, 23; Quint. v. 12, 21.
Though the old man could not see the reference to himself the audience could, and
would raise a laugh at the name Theothimus, the priest’s‚ sc. the eunuch’s son, which Ι
have no doubt the slave pronounced it as it stands in the Mss„ and which Ι believe
ought to be put in the text, for the absurdity of the reference is apparent, and latter
form is in all the MSS. The Megalobyzi of W. and R„ and Megalobusi of Fleck.‚ cannot
be adopted. The MSS„ Uss.‚ and Goetz support the reading in the text.
