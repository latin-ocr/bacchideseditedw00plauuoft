202 PLAUTI BACOHIDES.

long or short in Plautus (Cas. ii. 3, 34) and Hor. ; first long, last long or short, Pers. ;
first long or short, last long, Mart.; in Ter„ Phorm. v. 9, 12, both vowels appear to be
short. odiose faci83 as in 1058, and cp. Ten, Ad. iv. 2, 49.

1062. Ced03 “here, give it’'; see n. v. 720. necessest; absol„ as in Cic.‚
Tusc. i. ὃ, 17; sall. vii. iam; see n. v. 45. nevenevo sc. reret-term but cp. Miles
863; Cic.‚ de Orat. i. 38, 175; for tense see n. v. 208. In some of the old editions
(Stephanus) we have in this v. ad uos before iam and asaro before veut-meno.

1063. ΟυνᾶΐυηἹεῒ; the construction here is unusual; euro generally takes either
an accus. of person or thing or is followed by ut with subjunc.; but the slave here repeats
the words of the old man in mockery3 he uses the verb impersonally, wishing to keep
out of view the fact that he himself was the cause of his misery, and puts an accus. with
infinitive; both these forins are more indefinite than if he had used the personal
construction. He changes somewhat too the meaning of curo. Thisislost in the English;
in translating we must use a different word from that by which cura of the old man
is translated. curo with an accus. and the gerundivo is nothing but the accus. with
infinitive, and as esse has no gerundive the infinitivo is used here with this verb in
nearly the same sense. The slave could have said “Curaui te maxime miserendum,’'
taking “maxime nnserendum”zmiser‘vumum‚ for senem may be either part of the
predicate or in apposition to te. The chief point to be considered is not so much the
strict analysis and grannnar of the sentence as the general meaning intended by the
words used. It is evident that the notion of taking care must be remote, otherwise
either ut with subj.‚ or fut. infin. would be required to adequately express the meaning.
The question also arises‚ what is the passive, for instance, of Curari nares reficiendas!
It is surely “a me (or) mihi naves curatae sunt reficiendae''; it is no use for us to say
that such a phrase does not occur; this is the very form of the expression in the
text, and it appears to me to be more reasonable to take the natural meaning of the
word first, and then apply the test of grammar, than to make the sense subservient to
the grammar, and thereby render the latter inextricable. If this view be correct, all
Plautus has done here is to use a phrase in the passive which is generally found
in other writers in the active, but without to any great extent altering either the
meaning or grammatical structure of the words used, except that the verb is impersonal,
and that whatever slight change of meaning there may be results from the unusual
construction. This he had a perfect right to do, as no rules of grammar founded on
the general practice of later writers can fix the standard in every case for a writer so old.
The sense appears to be, ‘⁴ You have been rendered a very contemptible old man.'’ What
is here contended is, that the words in the text are all but identical in meaning with
“Curatus es tu senex 0550 maxime miserendus,'‘ or if the impersonal construction is
used, then with “Curatum est te senem esse maxime miserendum.” In Epid. ii. 2, 86
verb is pass. and impers. but is followed by 1ιε; 500 also Cic.‚ Att. xv. 15. Attius
(Phoenissae) has . . ut curentur diliyentius.
