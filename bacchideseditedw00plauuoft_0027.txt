TITUS MACCIUS PLAUTUS. xxi

Another proof for the form of the name as written above is from the first book of
Pliny, the naturahst, where “ Maecium Plautum '⁷ is found; but the reading, ⁴⁴ M. Accium
Plautum,'’ is equally admissible‚ and the only objection of the Ritschelian emenders, that
Pliny never gave any of the writers mentioned by him more than two names, is of little
weight. Again, in a letter of Fronto to M. Antonius, is read, ‘oh acy esni( re ubo »- um Aemus
Plautus sanus. ’³ The obj ections of Ritschl and others to this reading, that the m ought to
be taken with Accius, aan that two different persons may be referred to, that the passage
is corrupt, of which no proof' 13 given, and that Fronto ln the same 81113118 11113 written
Sallustium, one name, are very like supporting a theory on the 31811(181·831 of arguments.

(2) We may now examine the readings of the MSS„ and first those of the Paliinpsest
at the end of the Casina, where T, MA CCI PLA UTI (JASINA EXPLICAT is read
by Ritschl and those who follow him. Macci here has no more authority than M. Acci,
seeing that the words are not divided in the MS. Geppert has shown that the T is nothing
but a flourish of the writer or copier of the Ms.‚ and in the other place at the end of the
Epidicus there is no T, 3ο that even if it were to be written in the first case it has no
place in this.

Let us take now the readings of the other MSS„ “Mactici’' (B), or “Mactiti,‘’
and “Mattici” CDF. as given by Ritsehl. Martici (Editio Prinesps) (Prol. BIercatorl
and “Maccus'’ (B), “Macus'’ and “Macrus’' (Prol. Asinaria). The first three forms
are emended by Ritschl to‘ ‘Macci Titi‚” and the last three 10· ·Μ1101113,’ 111-111119 one
c for the sake of the metre. Any 01 the last three forms can be changed 10· ‘Mar cus''
with less violence to the MSS. than‘ ‘Macius‚'’ that of Ritschl. The objection of Uss„
that so many people being called Marcus, whoever wrote the prolog ues would not 111118
given the poet this common name alone, by which he cannot be distinguished from
others. Cicero frequently writes Tite. in his letters when addressing his friend Atticus,
using the familiar style, and Titus is quite as common a praenomen as Marcus, nor 13
there any obscurity. He also uses Gnaeus in speaking of Pompey‚ four or five times
repeated in the same letter, also Publius in speaking of Clodius, and always T iro, whose
full name after his freedom was Marcus Tullius Tiro. Tite is also found at the
beginning of his treatise “de Senectute.” Quintus too, in addressing Cicero, calls him
“Mi Marce '’ (Fam. xvi. 16); and my brother “ Quintus” is a usual form of speaking
with the great orator. Moreover, “M. Accii” would be a better emend. in the latter
case than that of Bitschl. For if this form was adopted the name would be reduced to⁴
something like uniformity; the two forms of the MSS. readings would become, in the
first case, ·· Marci Accii‚'⁷ and in the latter ·· Μ. Αο011,” whereas 31130111 makes our poet
“Macci” in one place and “Macci Titi’' in the other. This incongruity would be
rectified by discarding this emend, as has been the fate of so many others of that
distinguished scholar. Ritschl’s emendd. can scarcely be scanned in the prologues
mentioned below. The fact is, that the Romans had three ways of speaking of a person
by name, the “distinctive” style, as it may be called, distinguishing the person named
from all others, when the nomen or cognomen was used, and the “formal” style when
the whole name was written, pizaenomen nomen and cognomen, also the‘ ‘familias' style
as here, When the praenomen alone was employed. The prologues of the Comedies of
Plautus and Terence, whoever wrote those of the for‘mei poet, are 111 the familiar style,
bespeaking the indulgence of the audience for the favourite, and taking it into the
confidence of the speaker.

In the prologues to the Comedies of Terence, the poet’ s name 118181· occurs: it is
