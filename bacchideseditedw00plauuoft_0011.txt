PREFACE.

SOME years ago the Editor happened to lift an old edition of Ritschl containing the
Trinummus, DIe‘les Gloriosus, and Bacchides, and on making further enquiries about
English editions was considerably disappointed to find that, while other Latin writers
had received due attention, little or nothing had been done by English scholars for
Plautus, we may say, the father of Latin literature. As we have English editions of the
two first Comedies mentioned, the present edition of the Bacchides- is an attempt to
remedy this state of things.

The Oomedy is considered one of the best of Plautus, and is the one on which
RitschL sixty years ago, commenced his great and valuable labours on this poet. The
endeavour to bring it under the notice of English students, though a troublesome duty,
has not been a disagreeable one.

The text has been constructed with the assistance of the Critical Notes in Ritschl, in
Valpy’s Delphin Edition‚ Weise, Ussing, and Goetz. The printed editions used were
Valpy, Bothe, Weise, Ritschl, Fleckeisen, Ussing, Goetz, and some old editions, chiefly
that of Robert Stephens (1530), and the Delphin (1679). The Editor had intended,
before making out the text, to collate some of the MSS. for himself, but was prevented;
and had he been able to do so, it is not probable, unless one could devote a very con-
siderable time to the work, that much more could be procured from those sources than
has been already collected. The MSS. readings, unless where sense or metre is at fault,
have been very generally adhered to, and where these fail emendations have been
accepted. In a few cases in which neither MSS. readings nor emendations of former
editors can be admitted, owing to defect in sense or metre, one has been proposed.
In the Notes, where there is a difficulty, the different emendations are sometimes
given and their value discussed, and the reasons generally stated for or against their
admission or rejection. As studentS, when difficulties in metre or sense arise, may wish
to examine the different readings, the greater part of those recorded from the MSS.
mentioned in the Introduction has been given. The text is believed to approach nearer
to that of Ussing than of any other editor. Bentley's accents have been marked, but
without claiming for them any other utility than to show a student the species of metre
employed.

Ἰ Α very important matter for students of Plautus is the history of editions; a list has
¹ been given for the old editions from that of the Bipont in Valpy, from Dibdin, Moss,

Ἰ and chiefly from Ritschl’s Opuscula.
