COM-MENTARY AND NOTEs. 199

te iubeo; 666 n. v. 984, and cp. Curc. 145; Truc. ii. 8, 11. uet03 uota, for what
reason Ι cannot imagine, has been written here by F leck. and Uss. ; the latter has this
form in his text and ueto in his notes. With object of person expressed in Hor., Sat. i.
10, 32. suadeo; personal object expressed in Plautus, suasi urm-em, and in Ter.; also
in Cic. with accus.; but being expressed with one it can be supplied for the others. The
pronoun is frequently omitted with other verbs.

1040. mirum ; noun; cp. Ter„ Hec. iv. 4, 87.

1041. This v. and the one following have been given to the slave by the MSS. and
all editors; Ι had also given them to that character, but afterwards changed them on my
own responsibility, a change which Ι have now found has been proposed by Brachmann.
Having had doubts at first about giving the vv. to the slave, Ι believe the change
can be defended. It will be observed that the old man had considerable difficulty
in persuading Chrysalus to remain while the letter was being read, and that in vv.
998, 1023 the slave advises him not to give the money, and in vv. 999-1000 says
that he will not carry it if given, and further on persistently refuses to take it, until,
to avoid suspicion that he had anything to do with the letter and to prevent blame
afterwards, when he sees him yielding of his own accord, he distinctly refuses in
vv. 1032, 1039 to give him any advice in the matter. In vv. 1037& he lays two
alternatives before the old man— either to lose the money or permit a lover to swear
false, and ends with the words, “Ego neque te iubeo neque ueto neque suadeo.'‘ plus;
With reference to the first two hundred Philips already promised to the soldier. perdun-
dum sit, pePlSSffl it will be noticed that old Nic. is here playing with the same
notion; the passive of perdere and the active perire have almost, if not entirely, the
same meaning sc. the subject of each is plus. Chrysalus never could have used perdere,
it would be too strong after having employed it before, nor the perfect of perire, they
are the words of the old man, who takes up perdundum, from perdas of the slave
(v. 1038), and also employs flagitium, “the scandal‚” which he has already repeated
ironically (v. 1007) from the letter. The poet is making old Nic. pun on the words
perdundum, perisse, properem perdere, perierem in the letter, and perierec used by the
slave. The subj. mood is owing to his having borrowed both words and thought from
the slave, for he has already decided to give the gold. Suauiust3 of the MSS„ W„
Goetz and the old editions; R„ Fleck. and Uss. have satiust, of Scaliger and Dousa;
the form is found frequently in the texts of Ter„ and the sense is clear, “If more
is to be lost it is less disagreeable for it to havc gone,'’ dvc. Uss. in this place denies
that the notion of pleasantness can be thought of, but a similar objection may be made
against sarium it is neither an agreeable nor a satisfactory thing for one to lose two
hundred Philips; both forms, however, are often used for melius ext: here of course the
reference is rather to the mind or judgment than the feelings, and is, in my opinion, a
very proper expression for the old man to make use of.

1042. illud flagitium sc. illius flaffl'tium mentioned in the letter (v. 1028); also
in vv. 846, 855, 912, 956, 1005. uolgo: as in v. 858. dispalescewe sc. inceptive of
clispalor, found in Nepos (Lys. 5), said of soldiers; to be generally spread abroad; only
found here.

1043. Ne sc. nae, as in 500 and 999. edepol; see n. vv. 35, 157. mult03 see
n. v. 6. mauellern3 for form see n. v. 854; for construction, subjunctive with ut
omitted, cp. Pseud. 2093 Cic„ Fam. vii. 143 Tusc. i. 6, 12; i. 8, 173 Flac. xxix. 71.
