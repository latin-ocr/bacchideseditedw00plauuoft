111 INTRODUCTION.

Comica‚ ut aequato virtus polleret 11011010
Cum Graecis, neque in hac despectus parte jaceres.
Unum hoc maceror et doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

Did this reformer of the morals of the Roman Comic stage think that improvement
could be attained in these by introducing, in four out of his six Comedies, maidens
ravished by their lovers? Did he propose to reform the Courtesan class by painting
these vampires better than they were, and by bringing down, as in the Hecyra, the
more virtuous 10 their moral standard? These questions are important, seeing
that he was a teacher of what is correct in Comedy and, we may say, a moral reformer.
The Comedies of Plautus are, of course, full of such characters, but they are never in-
troduced except for 1110 purpose of showing off the weak points of the other sex, and of
getting themselves and their devotees laughed at. He never depicts them as trying to
make men or women better, but always worse. These and the “lenones’' and parasites
were the stock characters in ancient Comedy. Plautus in the Prologue to the
Captivi, 55-ὃὸ, informs his audience that in that Comedy they would meet with no
such characters. And no doubt he would have been glad to dispense with them in his
other plays had that been possible. Also the ten first lines of the Prologue to the
Psemlulns seem to mean that the poet considers himself sometimes bound to bring such
characters on the stage as may please all classes of his audience, good and bad alike.
It may be said that Terence was only a reformer of the language of Comedy, but he was
more than that. For he says in the Prologue to the Eunuchus,

Si quisquamst, qui placere se studeat bonis
Quam plurimis et minume multos laedere ;
In his poeta hic nomen profitetur suom.

Plautus has been censured for disclosing too much of the plot in his Prologues.
This censure may be just or it may not. Itis certain that the two poets whom we are
comparing did not look at the province of the Prologue from the same point of view.
The Prologues of Terence generally consist of a reply to “the old poet,’' an apology for
past failures, and are invariably a sort of special pleaders, 81010 enough, for the audience
to give him a favourable hearing. Whatever portions of the plot those of Plautus may

prologue than those of the other poet.

But let us hear Pareus on this point:—-—“We by no means think that those men

likewise one Asulanus, and others frequently did) much preferred, I do not know with

all the points in a just balance, they would of themselves have easily noticed that they
had compared a trumpet with a flute. For, indeed, it is certainly clear that Terentius
Afer is far inferior to our poet from the fact, that he did not produce, if not all. at least
the most of his elegancies for himself, but borrowed them in such a way that he decked
himself off, as it were, in the plumes of the other. And hence it is that Lavinius, a
respectable poet, did not hesitate to 0011 Terence, ‘Plautus the Thief.' Terence him-
self is 0 witness of it in the Prologue to the lenum-husa With good reason; for that
another again may, not without wit, give his judgment, ‘What Terence is, Plautus for
the most part made him.' The opinion of the very learned Jerome Gebuvilerus, who
