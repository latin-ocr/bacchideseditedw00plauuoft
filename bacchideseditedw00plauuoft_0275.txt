his being “exposed'’ to his son and the slave, as the word here has been translated,

n. .v. 73. habeo offirmatum ; for hahere with particip. see n. v. 14, and for
offirmatum see n. v. 1201 : after this word there is a lacuna in the MS. Β. R. and
Fleck. in their texts leave the v. incomplete; Uss. supplies “quod dixti '’ from conjecture,
marked by italics. W. and the old editions give the v. as complete. Ι cannot see that,
if an interrogative mark is put aiter offi vm atu m, there is any difficulty, for this portion
of the v. may be translated, “Have Ι that assured''? ‘⁶ Am I assured of that⁷’‘? Bacchis
repeats the words of the old man (vv. 1201-2) by which he, in fact, admits that he will
