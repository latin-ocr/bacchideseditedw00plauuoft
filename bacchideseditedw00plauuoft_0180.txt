120 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

remi (Virg.‚Aen. v. 120); terna Gratia (Claudian). In Plautus we have sinfmvli and
quini in sing.; cp. Cist. iv. 2, 36, and Pseud. 303. Translate, ‘¹ Look here, observe;
this now will be his third trick.'' The first, see v. 257 ; second, v. 263. If accipitrina
above could be taken as an adj .‚ agreeing with puyna to be supplied, it would give sense,
or perhaps the reading accipitri (dat.) followed by ozam might be accepted, for m is often
omitted in MSS. I think, however, that the explanation given is as feasible as either

of these.

272. Autoly003 grandfather of Ulysses, a noted thief, put here for a thief; see
Hom.,Il. x. 267; Od. xix. eoi-46& Ovid, Met. xi. 312.

273. Quin tu audi; “Nay, but do you listen.” Quin; with imper.; cp. As.
252; Miles 10-16; Cas. iii. 6, 40; Most. i. 3, 16, 30; ii. 1, 74. This is the third time
the slave has urged the old man to attend to the point. audi, it will be observed, is
not so strong a word as ausculta (v. 270), which he uses in introducing this part of his
story. lmm0; “to be sure’‘; see n. v. 144. Neither sense nor metre requires the
omission of this word, which has been left out in the texts of Weise and Uss. Were
any erasure needed, 1 would not hesitate 10 exclude <acidi in preference, which is very
probably a repetition of (ιιιιῖί,· 011(1 the fact that in BD it agrees in case with hospitis,
while in G inqem'um is made to conform in case with it, lends support to this view. I
would, however, retain both. Bothe, R„ and Fleck. transpose and insert words from
mere conjecture, and of which there is no trace in the MSS. Goetz is the only editor
that has the reading in the text.

275. Domum cupientes; “ eager for home.'' There is no instance of the use
of this verb in classical Latin with genit„ but it is quite probable that the older writers,
such as Plautus, did use it sometimes with genit. All the editors have, therefore,
adopted domi, R.’s emend. The only MS. authority brought forward in support of this
change appears to be the reading in A (Trin. 841), in which dmm· cupio is found. One
instance is hardly sufficient authority for the change, seeing that Plautus invariably has
cupere with accus. The reading in the text is that of all the MSS.,which Weise has
followed. ut ; originally a relative adverb, as a conjunction can be used in all clauses
except conditional and causal. It is here temporal, “as,'' “when,‘’ “as soon as‚'’
‘⁴ after⁷‘; cp. vv. 371, 385; As. 244, 340; Capt. 477; Men. iii. 2, 56; iv. 2, 77; Most.
i. 3, 63, 1113 Miles 114. adsedi (salcido). stega (στέγη), “deck”; cp. Stich. 413.

276. circumspecto; cp. Cic„ N. D. ii. 49; Tusc. i. 303 Liv. iv. 37. In Pseud.
912 011(1 Τ1·111. 863 there is an object expressed, in the latter of which the sense is the
same as here. atque; continues the part of the narrative commenced in preceding
sentence ; the sense is the same as if the sentence had begun with atque esso. In history
and oratory atque in such a position as it is found here would be inadinissible; but in
poetry, and especially comedy and the language of every-day life, considerable freedom
is allowable in the arrangement and connection of the different parts of a sentence.
And there is a change of sul›ject; or atque may connect this clause either with that
beginning with ut or J mm, when there would be no difficulty, for the slave is interrupted
by the old man and does not get finishing the sentence. In Latin writers of the best
period the sentence would have stood either with atque omitted or atque (²90 at the
beginning; but the unusual position of the conjunction does not prove carelessness on
the part of the writer or defect in the languagc at the time he wrote. This conjunctim,
