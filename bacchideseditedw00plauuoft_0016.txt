x INTRODUCTION.

carefulness by Chrysostomus without disgraee. Is St. Jerome to be branded with a
black mark because he has taken so much pleasure in reading Plautus? Who, in
short, would follow Cicero as a leader—not always a close imitator of Vesta’s lackeys
(domestic virtues)·? who, Juvenal and Horace? In a word, the epistles of St. Paul,
that renowned teacher of the Gentiles, are to be cast from us, especially those in which
he brings forward the terrible crime of ineest, foul crimes of the heathen, to be avoided
as worse than a dog and a serpent! Nay, indeed, the whole of the sacred Scriptures
would have to be blotted out in everlasting obhvion, and the whole age must be hushed
up to suit the standard of Catos too strict about fleeing from vice. But even those
Aristarchuses of somewhat free morals give ready assent to these who, most of all, as
the poet sings. ‘preach like Curii, live like Bacchanals.' As, therefore, the records of
sacred literature seem to bring vice into review‚ not that we may imitate it, but that
(which is best) we may make use of the excesses of others for our own improvement,
80 1110 stage of the Comic poets pourtrays wickedness (a very large crop of which may
be gathered everywhere around us), as in a mirror, somewhat prominent, before our
eyes, in order that it may inspire men with terror, and, on the other hand, that it may
rouse them up to a diligent observance of their duties. For what, (10 we suppose, was
the reason that Demodocus, that well—known Phaeacian, sang of the loves of Venus
and Mars? Was it that he was praising lust? No, n0; but that he was desirous
of applying to it a burning brand. And if (as the ‚Julian law enacts) it is not indecent
language, but the (leeds themselves, that are punished, who 01111 110 rightly angry with
Plautus ἱ) For if he brings on the stage some trifiing and unbecoming expressions, he
does it by a right belonging to his profession, for, Ι think, this reason, that men in that
way might give up their bad conduct by the 111010 contemplation of it. Wherefore‚ as
wines placed before a drunken man more easily entice him to indulge than one who is
temperate, so that freedom in Comedy may easily excite a bad and wicked nature, but
cannot entice a pure and upright man. Not therefore inaptly even is the reading of
the poets compared to some wide sea; although there are sharp rocks and also very
difficult shallows in it, yet a cautious and, at the same time, careful mariner does not
drive his ship into these; on the same principle there are some rocks in the books of
the poets which an upright man vigorously steers past, since it is inexpedient to run
into them; like the companions of Ulysses who. to avoid the enchanting songs of the
Sirens, stopped their ears with the melted wax and fiew past the cliffs, in order that
they might not be enticed to pleasures by these blandishments and suffer shipwreck.
Rightly‚ therefore, also Livia said that naked men did not differ from statues to chaste
women. And, since we are secking only amusement in our studies, what is to hinder
us from mingling with our sterner pursuits fun and polished wit of such a sort that the
mind is in this way refreshed after the bustle of business, and that the ears wearied with
wrangling and abuse may sometimes get rest? And, therefore, Ι do not indeed think
that the plays of Plautus, although some blemishes are found scattered here and there
in them, either through their own fault or that of the age, ought to be thrown aside.
For as excellent wine does not in any way cease to be wine, although mixed with a few
drops of water, so neither do I think that our own Plautus and other poets have lost
their splendour and charin with learned men, even if they meet with some of the baser
metal of mankind. But so much under this head; for with good men the weapons of
the objectors seem to have been sullieiently sliattered‚ and bad ones cannot be properly
argued with, though one should fight with the arms of Achilles.’'
