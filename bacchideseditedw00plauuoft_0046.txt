xl INTRODUCTION.

on those he intended to be short, while on those which were to be long it might or
might not fall; this latter, of course, depended on the kind of feet and metre employed.
The manner of recitation settled the quantity. If the doubtful syllable was to be short,
the actor either attached the consonants in pronunciation to the succeeding syllable,
if these were capable of conimencing one, or if they were doubled; or, if the syllable to
bc shortened was the last of a word whose ending was short, he dwelt a shorter time
on that syllable, without at the same time omitting either consonant or vowel in the
pronunciation. Out of the 200 cases of vowels long by position, shortened in this
Comedy. there are not more than half a dozen, est two or three times and hercle twice,
which cannot be explained as above: (1) both consonants to be taken with succeeding
vowel; (2) two consonants forming a nasal; (3) a doubled consonant; (4) short endings
not lengthened by position; (5) preposition with short ending compounded with a verb.
Of course these consonants were intended by the poet to be so pronounced, and so they
were pronounced by the actor. That is to say, Plautus could use those syllables either
long or short the quantity of which wavered in the popular pronunciation, and which
he so far settled that he assigned them a definite value in his verses. The fact of the
ictus falling on a syllable had nothing to do with length, for it might fall on either a
long or short syllable without affecting its quantity. The poet never assigned any onc
of these doubtful syllables a short quantity when under the ictus, and outside that
position used them generally long, but sometimes short, according to the necessities
of the feet employed. The word accent may have shortened some final syllables, but
this was not the work of Plautus, seeing that they were ready to his hand.

Bentley and Hermann do not agree as to the way the old Latin dramatists recited
their verses3 for the former, while striving hard to reconcile the word-accent and the
verse ictm, does not appear to assign so much weight to the ordinary accent of words,
seeing that he is obliged to yield the point that it is overridden by the ictus in the First
and Third Dipody. The latter, on the other hand, says that “two kinds of recitation
were used by the Latins; the one guided chiefly by the accents of words, and the ordinary
pronunciation, which was employed by the ancient actors; the other formed on the
Greek model‚‘’ &a See “Elementa Doctrinae Metricae‚'⁷ sec. ‘78 (Seager's Translation).
Hermann goes on to assign these shortenings to the popular pronunciation, and this
may have been the case with some final syllables, but such a change must have taken
place before Plautus employed such shortenings in his Comedies. Latin dramatis: poetry,
or poetry of any sort, never could have been recited by this method3 and until it can be
shown that the ancient Latins carried on their ordinary conversation in verse, any
attempt to prove that they recited their poetry in the same way must end in failure.
The word-accent had nothing to do with the recitation either of old or later Latin
poetry, except in so far as it agreed with the verse ictus; nor had it any power to
lengthen or shorten the quantity of a syllable in a foot in the verse itself‚ for whatever
force it had, that force had settled the quantity of the syllable which it affected before
it had been employed in forming portion of a foot in the verse.

It appears to us a strange inconsistency among scholars who have held or hold
such views on the Latin accent, that no ancient or modern Aristophanes ever thought
of elaborating a regular system of Latin accentuation such as we have in Greek, in
order that those who are ignorant of its power, though never destined to gain an
insight of its secret workings, might have at least obtained an outside view of its
appearance. The propounders of such theories of accentuation are refuted by almost
