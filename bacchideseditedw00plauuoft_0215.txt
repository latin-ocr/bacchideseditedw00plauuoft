This is in substance what he says. The antecedent 13 11010, 111 accordance with a well
known Latin idiom, attracted into the relative clause. pulsa; has been written in
preference to the reading of all the editors, who have pulta here; pulsat next v., and
pultare v. 582, which was probably the pronunciation of the word in the time of Plautus ;
see Quint. i. 4, 14, and cp. Most. ii. 1, 563 Poen. iii. 4, 1& also vv. 1114, 1118.

The most plausible etymology is that given above, in which the first r (the syllable
being without accent)‚ between two vowels, and followed by the same sound having
the accent, easily falls out. The prosody of the word 13 3130 3 subject of contention
amongst editors and critics. Rost 111-3111131113 that the first vowel 13 lengthened, but this
is impossible for the scansion of some of the vv. of Plautus in which it occurS,
and that it forms a dispondee, which would preclude the possibility of its being in voc.
case as it is, I believe, here and in Most. 8; Poen. i. 2, 1373 Trin. 457. W. dissents
strongly from the views of Rost, but his own are not quite clear when he says in
a note on this passage that it is nowhere a trisyllable, meaning, Ι take it, that it is
nowhere written directe. The same editor's note on the word in Men. ii. 3, 92 is open to
the same objection, for it is not easy to say what syllable he is speaking of. It can,
however, be gathered from the note that he 13 in favour of pronouncing the two first
syllables as one, and this is the view of Wagner, Ranisay, and Brix. Uss. agrees with
Rost that here and in some other places the first syllable is lengthened; R.,F1eek.‚
and Goetz are, I believe, agreed with the first-mentioned editors. The next point is the
meaning. I would be inclined to translate “ You scoundrel''; something like macte 111
