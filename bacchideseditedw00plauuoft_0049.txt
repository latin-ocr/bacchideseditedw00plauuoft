number employed than in the same feet in the odd places 01 the Septenarii in the same
proportion, and that the reverse of this is the case 111111 1110 other feet in the same
places in the metres mentioned. Therefore‚ the statement of some critics that the accent
is preserved better in the Septenarius than in the Senarius is not correct in the feet and
places examined in these 101-505. So then we have is Spondees altogether in 229
verses examined in which accent and ictus do not agree; 200 Spondees altogether in
these verses; 102 in the Senarius, in 23 01 which accent and ictus do not agree in
even feet; and 98 in the Septenarius, in 25 of which they are not in agreement in the
odd feet. If these instances are a fair specimen of Plautine usage, our opinion is,
that the “established fact” stated above is too strong, and that so far from being a
“curious⁷' or “established fact,’' it is not a fact at all. The same Senary verses (99)
above disprove Bentley’s theory that the accent and ictus agree in the Second Dipody,
for in the third and fourth feet of those lines 51 instances occur in which they do not
agree. They also disprove that scholar's statement that the shortening of a syllable
long by position generally takes place in the first foot of the Senarius. What he says
is, “I will only remark 01 this, what none, Ι 11011010, has done before me, that Terence
has admitted this license generally in the first foot of the verse, and very seldom in
any other place.’' Again, “Such, you perceive, vvas the 11150 judgment 01 Terence,
that he used this license only in the commencement 01 1115 101505, where the liberty
was pardonable; and he is the more to be excused. because he was not the first to
introduce this violation. He only retained a privilege which 110 received from the
example of Plautus,’' Cve. Not from Plautus certainly, 101 111 200 cases 01 shortening
in this Comedy, only 69 are in the first foot 01 the verse. There are rather more in
the first foot in the Septenarius than in the Senarius.
