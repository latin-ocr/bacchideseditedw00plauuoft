COMMENTARY AND NOTE S. 203

1067. ἰηῒθὲνυηυ “without a scar.'’

1069. triumphm as in v. 967. pevuolgatumst3 “it has become a common
thing”; cp. Cio„ Inv. ii. 39. Ritschl, referring to this, mentions thirteen triumphs as
having taken place in the ten years immediately preceding the two or three years before
the poet’s death. It may, however, be observed that Plautus is not concerned with the
facts of history; the expression is used here only for the purpose of heightening the
absurdity of the exploits of the slave, and might have been employed with equal effect
had no triumph at all occurred within the time mentioned, for a triumph, even if it had
not become hackneyed, would be no fitting reward for a general who has eclipsed the
deeds of Agamemnon. nihi! movom “ l do not at all care for such a thing’'; see n.
v. 151.

1070. Uer‘um tarnen; cp. Amph. 197; Miles 585. accipientum “will be
entertained''; cp. v. 1182; Pseud. 12543 Ter„ Eun. v. 8, 52. mulso; see v. 967.

1071. imm seen. v. 45. praedam . . . quaestorem deferam3 see Capt„
Prol. 34. quaestorem so. MneS.

1072. Quam mag-3583 “the more''; where a later writer would perhaps have used
quanto mccqz's· or eo mayfs followed by tanto or «μω with compar. ; cp. Trin. 861. Terence,
Hec. v. 1, 12, has qm) massis. tam must be supplied with Magis v. 1074. In v. 1087
tam is expressed, also in Poen. i. 2, 1383 in As. 157 the compar. is omitted in the
second member and tam. used alone; while in Men. 19 tanto stands instead of it. in
pectove; cp. n. v. 652. foue03 cherish, fondle, “revolve'’ quas . . tuvbas
tu Pbet; hardly different from turbas <lare (354) or quac turbauit (1087).

1073. Se ........ capessat; see n. v. 111. ad vitarm mode of life, as in
v. 339. moves; “ morals,'' as in v. 434. inscitus3 without knowing, thoughtless;
cp. Most. i. 3, 51; v. 2, 14; Miles 736; Ter., Hec. v. 1, 14.

1074. ouva& dat. adfor‘mid03 only here, but cp. Most. ii. 2, 78. convump-
atum see n. v. 1036.

1075. Scio; parentheti03 see n. v. 635. illa aetate3 said of a young person;
see n. v. 54. ΓηοΡθς as in v. 541. modest03 “moderate’'; see on modestia, v. 614,
and cp. Hor., Ep. i. 18, 94; Ter., And. 933 Ad. v. 8, 73 Hec. i. 2, 9Ο; with this v. cp.
v. 407 of same speaker. Phil. has told us this already in v. 407.

1076. placitant; only here3 almost the same as placent: “are not satisfactory.’'
morem as in 434, 10733 Cas. iv. 2, 4. quibus uideo uolgo gnatis esse
pavente& “in which I see parents are involved in general with their sons.⁷⁷ uolg0;
as in 858, 1042. This v. is condemned by W„ and indeed the last part of it is not quite
satisfactory.

1077. Duxi ; marry, hire or procure seems to be the meaning here, scortum of course
to be supplied, as in Men. i. 2, 15; Poen. i. 2, 60-1; Stich. 7283 Truc. iii. 2, 1Ο;
sometimes it may have the meaning of amare in bad sense. In Most. 35, iv. 3, 21 we
find a plural object where the sense is slightly different. In As. 163—4, 168, 188, 854,
Men. iv. 3, 20, Poen. iv. 2, 46 ductare, in Mero. iv. 4, 46 abductare, seem to have nearly
the same meaning as here. habui scortum ; “kept a mistress.” scortum ; see n.
v. 70. potaui ; as in 1190. dedi, donaui ; “ drank, gave away and made presents
to her''; the difference between dedi and donaui is not great; a pronoun, however,
must be supplied for scortum, otherwise the sense would be obscure. et enim id
