other is Euqe socium in verse 1102, ending a Proceleusmaticus in an Anapaestic line.
In 1166, seruom (Anapaestic) has last syllable lengthened.

Perhaps we are hardly correct in saying that there appear to be more cases of so-
called Hiatus in Senarii than in the Septenarius, from the fact that 3 are found in 40
verses, whilst there are only two in the same number of Septenary verses. It appears,
however, that there is a greater number of elisions in the Septenarius than in the Senarius,
for 67 have been discovered in 36 lines of the former, and only 53 in the same number
of the latter.

In verse 1177, an Anapaestic, we have 8 elisions3 and in 953, an Octonarius,
Iambic, 7; in 864, a Senarius, there are 6 elisions; and no doubt an equal number might
be found in other lines. In Homer, Ilias VII. 31-40, ten lines, there are 8 cases of Hiatus
in which there is neither Caesura nor ictus. Bentley, as has been previously mentioned,
attempted to remove the Hiatus in Homer, just as Ritsohl attempted to remove it in
Plautus. These great scholars both failed in their attempts, seeing that nobody has
followed them. Most of the cases of Hiatus in Virgil fall under one or other of the
restrictions mentioned above.

lnstances of long syllables snontened ancl short syllables lengthened

(Anapaestics); boni, 1189 (Anapaestics). Such forms as satin and ath do not require to
be noticed, for the ending is is short, and s falling off, the vowel of course remains short ;
incon and viden (twice) can be accounted for by the rule that n final is short, when of
course the vowel must be short. There are 9 imperatives, which are used short by
Virgil, leaving only 7 long vowels shortened, contrary to the usual practice of poets.

Short vowels lengthened. Βειιῐιτῐόν, 121 (Semnus), under the ictus3 νωνῶν,
1115 (Septenarius), ictus, Caesura‚ and change of speaker; Latona, 888 (Senarius‘)‚
ictus, followed by a pause; soror, 1138 (Bacchiae), Caesura, ictus, and change of speaker;
amator, 1162 (Anapaestics), under the ictus. Virgil often uses such syllables long in
Arsis. Four instances of Diaeresis, semusti, 875 (Senarius); seruauit, 947 (Octonarius,

V.—AGCENT, διο.

After an examination of the Metres and Prosody of the Bacchides, and the reading
of the dull, drowsy, dusty and prosy tomes, in which may be discovered a few facts,
(Apparent rari nantes in ymyite vasto), written on the Metres of the Latin Oomic
poets, one is almost inclined to enquire what they are all about, and to agree with the
late Professor Blackie3 after quoting Erasmus on the subject, who writes, “Vel ab
