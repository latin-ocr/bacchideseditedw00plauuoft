PLAUTUS. xv

jokes and allusions, drawn principally from the lower orders, or taken from the Greek
and adapted to the common sort of people, did not interest him ‘' (Macleane Hor. Epis.
ii. 1, 170, note). But what is to be thought of the consistency of a critic and a poet,
if “inurbanum,'' v. 270 above, means “coai'se,'' who could write such verses as Epml.
12, and Sat. i. 2 ut, to quote his own words, equis proee'zcrreret albis, anything to be found
in the whole of Plautus. Plautus was no debauchee. The line of Davus,

J am moechus Romae, jam mallet doctus Athenis

Vivere,
would exactly fit the man who wrote the Epode mentioned. But the slave caps
the allusion, when he says,

Te conjux aliena capit meretricula Davum;
Peccat uter nostrum cruce dignius ἵ)

The whole Satire (ii. 7) is well worth reading· in this connection. Because Horace
was a great Court poet and literary critic he could write as he wished, and live as he
wished, drinking Falernian wine, writing artistic trifies, and sneering at Plautus and
the old poets who created the Roman Drama. Such a poet as Plautus or Juvenal would
have been required in his days to strip off the thin veneer of so-called Greek culture, and
exhibit a Roman citizen like Horace in his true colours.

Horace has shown, from what has been said above, that he was no judge of what
was coarse or what was “fine’'; such criticisms would be most unjust in any critic, but
in the poet mentioned they are little short of impudence (nec tamen flocci sileio). He
cannot be of such “Naris obesze’⁷ as to write the above and at the same time “fit
Aristarchus.” The fact is that the “lepidissimus homuncio ’' was too much of a courtier
to appreciate Plautus’ home-spun

His flattery of his patrons, Augustus and Maecenas, exceeds all bounds, see (jd. i.
