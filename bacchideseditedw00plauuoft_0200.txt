140 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

425. lbi 30. palaestra. hasta; see n. v. 69. disco; n. v. 65. pugilatu;
“boxing’'; see v. 593.

426. saulis: n. v. 47: as a terni of endem-ment, 300 Ter., Eun. iii. 2, 3.

427. aetatem extendebant; “pi-elonging their lives.’' aetatem cp. vv.
352, 776; l'ocu. iv. 2, 6; and see n. v. 54. latebrosis locis; 300 v. 54.

428. The poet, after connecting this v. with what precedes by Inde, adds a new
term, de Ιιίμ, and repeat-s pal. with more explicit reference to the place meant. hippo-
dromo. Pliny, Epist. v. 6, and Martial xii. 50, use this word in reference to a place
attached to a private mansion3 here the public “racc-course” at Athens, similar to the
“circus’' at Rome, is meant; cp. Cist. ii. 3, 7, 10. ubi reuenisse83 the indicative
might also be employed. but of course not with same meaning. Definite relat. advs. in
Latin, used as conjunctions in an indefinite sense, take subjunctive mood ; see Liv. 1. 32.

429. Cinctloulo maminotus “ tucked up with your belt '’ 30. neat and modestly
dressed; for latter 300 Hor„ S. ii. 8, 70. sella; “stool.'' adsidere& “you would
sit.'‘ This is the apodosis to uhi renen„ preced. v. The subj. is unusual, imperf. indic.
being the ordinary construction. It appears to be here due to the subj. in nbi clause,
a sort of attraction; for meaning cp. v. 275; Ter.‚ Heaut. 72.

430. Quom (temporal), with subj. ; the action of the verb being repeated. Definite
relat. adv. used in indefinite sense, hence subj. syllabam, (accus. of cognate or
equivalent notion).

431. cor’iu m, for eutis or pellis,¹ in a disrespectful sense; in Miles 29 it is put for the
hide of an elephant ; cp. Epid. 67, 93. Horace employs it in a bad sense. maculosum ;
marked with stripes, as a nurse’s dress. pallium ; see n. v. 69.

432. ἁίεΟΡυο1οΡ; cp. Trin. 103; Το1·., Ad. iv. 4, 1; also Aul. 105; Cas. ii. 3, 60.

433. suspicionem. Some editors of the classics admit the form suspitio, which
is often found in MSS„ but surely the 1130 of two forms of the same word is confusing.
The latter ought, I believe, to be discarded, as it can only represent the probable pronun-
ciation at the time the MSS. were copied, or, what is 111010 likely, has been wrongly
written for the first. There can scarcely be a doubt that the word was originally
written s-nspicim'o. One of the three short syllables, spi, ci, ti, would have a tendency to
fall out in pronunciation ; 1110 30001111 13 part of the root, and 13 therefore more likely to
have been retained than the suffix. Besides, ei and ti are frequently confounded in
the best MSS„ and this confusion would be greater when both came together. The
question is, how did Plautus write the word, and how was it pronounced in his time?
I think it is safe to say that he wrote suspiciat, and that 1· had the hard sound of lc:
hence the t, as has been said above, 13 11110 10 1110 transcribers. causa mea; 300 11. v. 87.

435. hon. cap. suf. In 130 Β.0. a law was passed laying down the ages (27
floiiv thsjiogige of questor) at which candidates might 3110 for offices of state; but see
Υ436.. Quam, prius quam, followed by imperf. 1111110.,13 hardly found except in
Plautus; but the tense of main verb, which is imperf, decides the mood of subordinate.
