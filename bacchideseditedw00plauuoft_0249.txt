COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 189

They were, I suppose, found in the responses of some oracle, or contained in some old
prophecy, and generally spoken of and believed. It is rather strange that matters so im-
portant are not mentioned by Virgil ; they were, first, the removal of the Palladium from
the citade13 second, an embrasure in the walls built by divine hands ; third, the death of
Troilus, youngest son of Priam. The two last do not appear to have much to do with fate;
a breach in the walls and the death of a hero would evidently be disastrous to the defence of
the city; in Aen. ii. 165 the epithetfatale is applied to the Palladium. Plautus, in v. 950,
mentions another circumstance, the tearing down of the lintel of the Scaean gate, over
which, Servius in his note on Aen. ii. 13 says, was the tomb of Laomedon, but this may
be only another version of the second fate mentioned here. Other prophecies with regard
to Troy were that it could not be taken without the arms of Hercules, in the possession
of Philoctetes (see Soph.‚ Phil. 1439-40), and unless one of the posterity of Achilles
were present, and unless the horses of Rhesus were captured before they had eaten of
the pastures of Troy and drunk of the waters of the Xanthus3 see Virg„ Aen. i. 472-:3 ;
Hom., Il. x. 427, &c.; Eur., Rhes. 613, Cve. forent; 1 had put “fuere,‘’ R.'s reading
of A, as Fleck. has done, in the text; Ι have changed it for three reasons; first, the
verb of relative clause depends on fuiss-e .· second, a subj. and a fut. subj. too is
required, for the slave is still keeping the old man in view, and therefore the action is
prospective; third, the first destiny is put in the next v. in the form of a condition.
Besides, the reading of A does not appear to improve the metre, and it gives worse sense;
and as the two readings are much the same in form, Ι would say that a mistake has been

mag? εξοιὲῒ, that in A. All editors, except the two mentioned above, have the reading

the second sc. fatum. ,· he did not say “primum fatum,” but expressed it by a conditional
clause, and so here he puts in etiam, showing that “fatum” is to be supplied, as it is
implied in preced. etiarn, is omitted by Uss„ and antem put instead by R. and Fleck.
Is it bad Latin ἱ) 01 is the metre bad? We are not told this. Supposing the Latin may
not be so elegant as might be written, nor the metre perfect, still neither of the emends.
above, in my opinion, make any improvement in either, and therefore they ought to be
rejected. W. also and Groetz have followed the MSS. ε t; what has been said of
etiam above may in the main be repeated of est. [ss. writ ‚ficit ; surely the slave may
look at the incidents of his story from different point of view; the third fate is
expressed by a temporal clause whose verb depends on fuisse, 9463 the description
of the second fate is an independent statement. The slave being engaged in a great
siege, the death of Troilus as involving great danger to himself, is clearly before his
eyes, for on the presentation of the tabellae to the old man he is ordered to be bound (vv.
794-5), and in 955 he says, ‘⁴ Then I killed Troilus.’' Ussing's v. cannot be scanned.
