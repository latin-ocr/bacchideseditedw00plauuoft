COMMENTARY Axi) NOTES. 105

Hence the only objection of critics is to the repetition of similar sounds, but this was no
fault in ancient comedy, nor indeed is it one in inodern3 our own Shakespere abounds in
such conceits; cp. v. 321; Cas. v. 1, 15, 16; Mero, Prol. 78; Capt. 1923 Pseud. 9Ο;
Cic„ Mur. 373 Aesch, Pers. 10413 Soph.‚ Ajax 3663 Eurip, Hec. 698-9; Lucret. v.
1190. Also notice the repetition Aul. 30, &c.; Epid. i. 2, 10; iii. 1, 12-13, 16-17; Atque
atque aceedit muros Romana ,jue-entus (Ennius); also Cic„ Mur. xxxvii. 78; Pro Milone.
xi. 31; xii. 33. It was a ready way of amusing their audiences; Aristophanes abounds in
such repetitions, but he also coins words of his own to suit his purpose—a practice more
open to censure—and in this he is also followed by Plautus. In case the explanation of
first intus given above might not seem entirely conclusive, then I would call the phrase an
instance of alliterat-ion or repetition for the purpose of emphasis. Intus- may have been
omitted in Β by some copyist; and the agreement of CD is certainly more convincing proof
that the poet wrote intus intus than the emendations of above editors, no two of whom
are agreed, implying that he did not. lt is, of course, easy to call the reading of OD ditto-
graphy, or something of that sort, but what are we to call the emendations? For second
intus cp. vv. 224, 569, 12063 Capt. 114, 1010, 1012; Aul. 36, 80—23 Cist. v. 7; Cas.

140. Weise reads herePraesvntc paedaswgsus illix, &c.; Bothe, Praesente et paedafflngsus
una illis, &c.; Bitschl omits una, and also proposes lr’raesente ihus una, sc„ omitting illis,
which Fleck. adopts; Miiller has Praesens- simitu, &c., omitting illis and una .· Uss. reads
Praesens ibi ullus, &c., omitting illis- and una. All the MSS. give the reading in the text,
except that they have siet.. N one of the emendations are, to my mind, satisfactory, and
the Praesente of W„ Bothe, R, and Fleck. is inadmissible, for the case is dative3 cp.
Virg., Aen. viii. 104. The only difficulty is with the metre. Plautus, I believe, wrote
seit, which the copyist took for siet, therefore Ι have put sit in the text; ut depends on
consentaneum.

144. lmm0; abl. of imus, and ought perhaps to be written imo, but I have followed
the usual orthography. It expresses denial, contradiction, dissent from, or qualifies a
previous statement; cp. vv. 204-6, 208, 218, 273, 313, 337 572, 669, 637, 695, 887,1177 ;

donnum. It is hard to see how any of these emendations can be admitted, consequently
the MS. reading has been adopted. The tutor, refusing to go farther, and assuming
that his pupil will return with him, says, ‘⁴ Ι 3111 going home.‘’ · ⁷ ’-
