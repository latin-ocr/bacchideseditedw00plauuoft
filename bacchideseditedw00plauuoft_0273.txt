COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 213

see also Caes.‚ Bell. Civ. ii. 32; Cic„ Off. i. 1, 2; Att. i. 20, 3; xii. 28, 2. [11; 500 11.
v. 128. accethS3 see n. v. 1070. Sim acceptus; pres. perf.; “am entertained.⁷'

1183. ΡὴὶΙίρρ15; abl.; see n. v. 217, 2273 500 also vv. 929, 969, 1046. circum-
duxerunt3 see n. v. 308.

1184. ut3 “indignantis’' or concessive; the former a form 01 the construction
noted v. 194; cp. Hor.‚ Epist. i. 18, 16; the latter sc. “fac ut,” supposing that; cp.
As. 272; Men. i. 3, 34; Cic.,Att. ii. 15; Fam. i. 9, 13. Either classification will
bring out the right meaning; I would prefer the former. excruciem; this verb is
found in Epid. iii. 3, 8; Cas. ii. 3, 11 ; Miles 1068, 1280; Pers. i. 34; Rud. ii. 3, 57;
Trin. 2873 Poen. v. 5, 233 Ter„ Phorm. i. 4, 1Ο; Ε1111. v. 3, 11 ; 0101101111. v. 11 ; the
slave has told us (vv. 358-9) that the old man will change his name and make him
Crucisalus from Chrysalus; see also his threat vv. 775-6.

1185. ΑΙῒΘΡυηΊ tantum au r‘i ; another (or second) sum 01 money so large, or ‘⁴ such
another sum 01 money.'' meream ; “would deserve ’⁷; the conditional here is in favour
of the explanation 01 1150 01 ut mentioned in n. preced. v.‚ for this is the verb 01 1110
apodosis answering to that 01 the protasis introduced by ut,- any other explanation
would render an account 01 1110 mood here difficult.

1186. Quid . Si 3 see n. v. 773 here we have the indic. as in v. 33 and Men. v. 2,
91; 1110 question is emphasised by tandem . dimidium auri redditur? again v.
1190. Whatever excuse they might be able to give for cheating the old man out 01 the
first two hundred Philips, they can make no defence with reg-ard to the second; hence
Bacchis tries to make him believe, in order that she may 0111100 him into the house, that
she considers the extortion of the second two hundred open robbery. int ΡΟ ; see n. v. 103.

1187. ut3 either concessive, as in the second explanation given in n. v. 1184, or 01
purpose, and depending on “isne hac mecum intro,’⁷ preced. v.‚ or on that phrase to be
supplied after Atque. Fleok„ Uss. and Goetz have here adopted the emend. of R„ i.e.,
induces animum, llaec being inserted between Atque and ut, but this is merely
conjectural and to fill up the v.; W. thinks the words are spurious. delicta; as in
1170. ignosca83 with accus.; cp. Amph. 2533 Ter.‚ Heaut. ii. 1, 6; iv. 1, 34.

1188. Minume3 “by no means.'’ nolo; “I won't.’' nihi! movom see n. v.
151. sine sic; “let 1110 010110 now'’; cp. v. 1132. Sine; see n. v. 21. sic; see n. v.
1001. malo; ‘⁴ Ι would prefer.” ambo; Nic. speaks 01 110111 1110 young men in vv.
1112, 1114; here he evidently means Mnes. and Chrysalus, as eis preced. v. ; last four
words are evidently his answer to the words in preced. v. only.

1189. Etiam; Uss. puts an interrogative mark after this word, but as he holds
that in questions it has nearly the force 01 quin, Ι cannot see why he refuses to join it
here with an imper„ for qum with an imper. hardly differs from quin in questions ; W„
R„ Fleck. and Goetz punctuate as in the text. homo nihili ; 500 n. v. 899. boni ;
I would prefer to take this adj. as a gen. depend. on quod or id, its antecedent,
suppressed. honi di,- is generally employed as an exclamati0n3 either way gives the
meaning with little or no difference 3 we have the gen. in Amph. 630; Ter, Phorm. iii.
2, 31. caue; see n. v. 905. amissis sc. “ainiseris’'; see 11. v. 599.

1190. Dimidium aui⁶i3 asin vv.318‚1186. potesque sc.p‹›ta›·‹⁷; as in v. 1077.

1191. Egone . . . potem; deliberative or dubitative conjunctive, as in 1193;
“am I t0,” or “can I” ἰ) οοηΡυΓηραῒυΡ; 500 n. v. 1036.
