METRE 8 AND PRO SODY. xxxi

poetarum scenicorum, eumque praecipuum omnis Latinitatis fontem ’⁹ διο. Da Plautus
der 6116316 611101 131 (1611 wir aus der eben begonnenen Romischen Litterature, und zwar
in einer gewissen Vollstandigkeit, besitzen, so hat er ein mannichfaltiges Interesse,
wenn man ihn auch nur als Denkmal der demaligen Sprache und Bildung betrachtet
(Bernhardy Grundriss de}- Rom. Lz't„ p. 385). Livius Andronicus can hardly be called a
Latin writer. See Cic. Brutus, 18, 71. . . Et Livianae fabulae 11011 36113 dignae, quae
iterum legantur. And as regards Naevius, unfortunately we have no means of estimating
the value of his Comedies. if, in comparing the importance of the Comedies of Naevius
with those of Plautus, we are to assign 1116 palm to the latter poet owing 10 1113 works‚
from their popularity, having survived the ravages of time, we must enshrine him as
the high priest of all Latin literature whatsoever. And although a work of Aristotle has
been recently discovered in Egypt, we think it improbable and hardly possible that 6 MS.
of a Latin book as old as the Comedies of Plautus can exist in any library of Europe—
the libraries having been so carefully explored by scholars during the present century.

(2) It does not require a long exposition to show the debt the early Latin poets
owe 10 1116 Greeks. Greek literature, which was studied, learned, and taught in schools
throughout that part of the Italian peninsula inhabited by the Latin race, was not only
well known to the learned during the time of Plautus, but the language was familiar to
the common people from intercourse with the Greek colonies in the south, and from
having learned it from the Greek slaves, many of whom had been brought into
Italy 61 11161 time. 11 gave them then (1) the Form or outline of the 8611161106 and
Clause, (2) the Metre, (3) the Matter for their Comedies, and somewhat expanded their
Syntax. What it did not give them was their Grammatical apparatus, the Quantity of

. vowels, and the Accent which were produced by the Latin tongue itself and gradually

developed by the early poets. The problem then that our poet had before him was to
wed, so 10 speak, Latin words to Greek numbers, without having any models in Latin
literature for his guidance, except the Comedies and Tragedies of Naevius and the
translations of Andronicus, who was 6 Greek. When we find Ennius called by writers
on the old Roman poets “The father of Latin poetry‚'’ that only means that he was
the first Latin poet who settled the quantities of Latin vowels so far that he was able
to write Dactylic Hexameters, and thus to produce a model in that Metre for all writers
who followed him.

(3) In pursuing our studies on these points, students of Plautus, or of any 011161
1161111 poet, need not be reminded that “quantity'' is applicable to vowels alone, and
that consonants only modify the quantity of the vowel. Quantity in Prosody, Latin or
Greek, means “ time,'’ and a long vowel is one that takes a longer time for its enuncia-
tion or utterance than a short one. Suppose we take the two words cantum and casuum
the first is pronounced can-tum, with the first vowel naturally short, not because n is
attached to it in pronunciation, but because it takes less time in the utterance than the a
in ccl-Sum, which is long. A long vowel is seldom followed by two consonants belonging
10 different syllables in 1161111; for though the a in ean-tum is naturally the same length
as in ca-nO, the former is called long by the rule of position, notwithstanding the fact
that they are both naturally short and that the latter of the two consonants goes with
the following syllable; the separation of the consonants in pronunciation has the same
effect as if the vowel was naturally long—that is, it occupies the same time in utterance.

The Greeks might have ten long vowels, counting the rule of position, and
five short, and the Latins, after that rule was admitted, the same number. The
