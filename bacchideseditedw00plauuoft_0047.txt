METRES AND PRosoDY. xli

every line of Plautus. Bentley himself was obliged to give up the First and Third
Dipody; and anyone by scanning a few lines of a Latin Comedy will at once see that
even in the Second and Fourth the theory will not hold. Corssen ii„ p. 470, says,
“der Wortton auf den Bau des altromischen Verses gar keinen Einfluss gehabt.⁷'
We hold that the feasibility of measuring English verse by quantity would appear to
be a much easier problem than that of scanning Latin verse by accent.

(7) The next point to be noticed is one which we had hoped had been long since
laid at rest—we mean the theory of Bentley and his followers as to the agreement of
the word-accent and ictus in the Comedies of Terence, with whom that great scholar
was more immediately concerned; for if it can be demonstrated in the case of the writer
just mentioned, it must hold also in Plautus. We have often wondered, when reading
verse 1084 of this Comedy, how Bentley, or any of his followers, would reconcile their
theory of accent with the scansion of such a ΗΒΘ-«δειλή, stolidi, satui,f10n91·‚ hardi,
blemm‘, baccones· A verse like this is generally passed over without any comment.
But it may be said this is an Anapaestic verse, and as there are no Anapaestics in
Terence, the theory does not apply. We would suppose that Anapaestics are rather
Iambic in rhythm than Trochaic, and here there are only two Anapaests, the rest being
all Spondees, and therefore Trochaic, yet not a single accent, except the last, is preserved
in the whole line. One thing we may be quite certain of, that Plautus, when he wrote
it, knew nothing of such a law.

The editor being engaged in the same study as others in the explanation of the
Comedies of this poet, has no desire to go out of his way to criticise their work, and
does not need to apologize in referring to scholars whose arguments may not agree
with his own, seeing that he may be expected to give his reasons for accepting or
rejecting the latest views on the subject; for his sole aim is to arrive at the truth, so
far as that may be possible.

We may state here what is only too well known already, that a considerable portion,
larger than we had expected to find, of the knowledge of learned men at the present
time of the Metres and Prosody of the two Latin Comic poets can be traced to the
“Schediasma'' of Bentley, prefixed to his edition of Terence published in 1726, and
to the ‘⁴ Elementa Doctrinae Metricae ⁷’ of Hermann, published in 1816, and,
lastly, the “ Prolegomena '’ of Frederick Ritschl, prefixed to his critical edition of the
Τνίηιωηηηιε, Bacchides, and Miles Gloriosus in 1845. The first of these scholars never
gave us an edition of any of the Comedies of Plautus, and all we have from him on that
poet are some emendations written on the margins of three or four old editions once in
his possession, lately published by Professor Sonnenschein. Hermann edited two of
the Comedies, and Ritschl nine. The work of the last on Plautus far exceeds that of
the other two, for he collated the most important MSS. of that poet, and, as has been
just stated, published critical editions of nine of his Comedies. However great was
the work of these learned men, and especially of the last, it can hardly be denied that
many of those who have succeeded them in studies of the same class have been too
eager to adopt their views on the Metres and Prosody of the Comic poets.

With all Bentley⁷s faculty for emendation, which he exercised freely on the text of
Terence, he soon found it beyond his powers to reduce the Prosody of the Comediesof
that poet to the rules followed by the Augustan writers; hence he was obliged to devise
a theory for the purpose of explaining it. The “ Schediasma” was the result, a treatise
