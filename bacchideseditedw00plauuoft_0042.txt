xxxvi. INTRODUCTION.

playfully enquires about the keeper of the sheep. There is clearly a tendency on the part
of the speakers to hurry over the. five monosyllabic words all grouped together in the
middle of the verse. The same word is three times shortened‚ or rather, we should say,
is used short. Old Nic. chimes iffwith his answer to the sister's question, helping her
to complete the verse, and uses the same word, atque, and with the same weight of
utterance as she herself had employed.

(5) The next important Metre to be examined is the septenarius, ον’ Τνοοὴᾶἰο
Tetrameter· Gataflectic.

The admissible trisyllabic feet in this Metre are the same as in the Senarius,
except that the Dactyl and Anapfest are excluded from the seventh place, where the foot
must be a Trochee or Tribrach. The Spondee can also be used in any of the six first
feet. This verse is Asynartete; that is to say, the last syllable of the fourth foot may
be long or short, and the non-elision of a vowel at the end of that foot before a word
beginning with a vowel does not cause hiatus. Of course the predominant foot is the
Trochee, which can stand in all the seven places. The verse consists of seven feet and
a 3 llable.

fails.

(V. 38.) ‘⁴ Quid in consilio cdnsuluistis? Ba. Bene. Pist. Pol haud meretricumst ’';
ῑη, b ’ the rule.

{V 39.) “Miserius nihil est quam mulier. Pist. Qm'd esse dicis dignius ‘2” esse,
b the rule.

y (V. 41.) ab istoc milite, ut, ubi emeritum si'bi sit, sc reuehat domum’'; istoc,
according to the rule.

(V. 44.) “N am si haec habeat aurum, quod illi renumeret, faciat lubens’‘; illi,
b the rule.

y (V. 45.) ‘⁶ Ubi nunc is homost? Ba. Jam hic, credo, aderit. Sed hoc idem apud
nos rectius ‘¹ ; apud, by the rule.

(V. 46.) “Poteris agere, atque 1's dum ueniat, sedens ibi opperibere.‘' Seeing
that Plautus very generally lengthens vowels by the rule of position, and that his 300111-
ing violations of it ought to be reduced to as small a number as possible, also that in
the Septenarius he does not always divide the verse at the end of the fourth foot—for if
he were invariably to do 30, 111 1110 fourth foot of verse 43 1110 first syllable of ille in hance
ille would have to be shortened in violation of the rule, which can be avoided by the elision
of e followed by habeat—we would prefer to shorten last syllable of ueniat in this verse,
although here also the rule cannot apply, and pronounce ueni in ueniat as a single
syllable, and thereby avoid the absurdity of shortening the final syllable of sedens, which
is long by natme and for tified by a pair of consonants. This 10130 may be scanned in
three diflerent ways, any one of which is better than to shorten the final sy llable of
se lens: the method just giv‚en which has often to be applied to the Hexameters of Vn g1l
the elision of dum before 11, which is sometimes a 1011101 and sometimes a consonant;
or the shortening of lum and taking zat of mniat as a single syllable. On the whole,
the second method is the easiest; we believe the last is preferable. A. Spengel and all
the Ritschelians solve the difficulty here by striking out the first vowel in the scansion.
Though Spengel is generallya sound critic of the Prosody of Plautus, and not a Bitschelian,
we cannot follow him in this. We cannot make Plautus write like a Greek or Augustan
