144 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

gei-und may be used in the nom„ although the infinitive is the general usage; see Latin
G.‚ vol. ii. lxxi. When the infinitive has a subject it is quite wrong to say that it is
used for the gemuel, but when it is a real verbal substantive, a pure gerund, as often
after jubere, it is different. What is unusual here is not the use of the infinitive, but
the meaning of conpesce sc. desiste, which renders that construction inevitable. The verb
must be either taken as intransitive or ce supplied for object. Ι 111011110 to the belief
that this verb ought to be written eonperca: and in fact Dousa and others have so
written the word here; see Poen. i. 2, 39. Compei-ee rer-bis reliam-e . . S. Turpilius

846. What the slave wishes to say is, that he would prefer that his young master should
have the liberty of punishing him, as he has already told us young gents. of his age are
in the habit of doing, rather than that he should have control over his sayings. It will
be observed that this v. is a reply to the first words of Phil. v. 460, and that the long
line of liquid letters, nearly every word ending with m, is intended by the speaker as a
sort of clue to the sense. peculium ; cp. Cas. ii. 2, 273 ii. 3, 42; Merc., Prol. 95.

466. quum. In strictly temporal clauses quum with an imperfect indic. in connec-
tion with a principal sentence with perfect of same mood is extremely rare. Such
clauses, however, are to be met with, and admit of satisfactory explanation. Here we
have such a connection of tenses3 but while sentences of this sort have no other
connection than that of time, in this instance we have the quum. clause in direct depend-
ence on the principal verb, and as much dependent on it as an accus. after a transitive
verb. The usual construction would be quum periret3 Plautus, however, often employs
the indic. in dependent clauses. Eithcr mood is admissible3 indic. gives the logical
dependence and subj. the grammatical ; cp. Capt. 302 ; Cic„ Fam. ix. 25, and see n. v. 9.
