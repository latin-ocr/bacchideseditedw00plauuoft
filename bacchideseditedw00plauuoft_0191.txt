n. v. 208.

359. Crucisalum; a pun on his own name, “quasi crucem salientem'' (Uss.);
cp. v. 127; Amph. 380; Men. ii. 1, 423 Miles 289, 330, 494; Pseud. 229, 712, 736.

360. her‘cie; see n. v. 208. usus υθηθνίῒς “if there shall have been greater
necessity”; cp. Cist. 1. 2, 28; Merc. iii. 1, 2Ο; Stich. 475; Ter„ Heaut. iii. 2, 42, 45-6;
Ad. v. 6, ¹7; Phorm. i. 2, 23; iii. 2, 20.

361. Si er‘o reprehensus, macto, is not really a conditional proposition, for
the present indic. after fut. perf, when both verbs have the same subject, is scarcely ever
met with. Si expresses rather the cause than the condition of the sentence with macto,
and is to be explained as an irregularity of almost the same class as when it takes a
subj. in protasis followed by an indic. in apodosis3 only here it is the use of tenses, not
moods, that is irregular. We can say, “ Ι am loading (for a fut.) him with misfortune,
if Ι shall have been caught.'' With macto cp. v. 881; Aul. 5273 Amph. 1027;
Cure. 536; Trin. 99& Poen. iii. 1, 143 Ter„ Phorm. v. 8, 39.

362. uivgae ; see n. vv. 22-23. The slaves were beaten with rods at the mills or
farms in the country. tergum domist, domi, in reference to r‘ur‘i; “my back is
ready’'; see n. v. 222.

363. er‘iii; see 11. v. 168. eius, found in the MSS„ is retained by Uss. alone of
recent editors, but he suspects that this and following v. are not genuine ; sc. senis, genit.
object.‚ dependent on fabr‘icam, with which cp. Cist. ii. 2, 5; Miles 1473 Epid. v. 2,
24; Ter.‚Heaut. iii. 2, 34. dabo; “I shall explain3 cp. Ter„ Heaut. Prol. 10; Hec.
v. 4, 29; Virg., Bucol. i. 19; Hor.‚ S. ii. 8, 4; Cic., Acad. i. 3. The lines may be
rendered, “I shall put the deception against him about the gold before my master’s son,
and shall tell him about the discovery of his mistress, Bacchis.'’ dare literas and dare
fabulam seem to be connected in this sense. That the meaning of dabo, given above,
is the correct one may be seen from a reference to w. 388-93 and as it may 116 used in
this sense with or without an object, fabricam can be supplied with amicaque, &c., for
both circumstances are again referred to together in the lines cited. And it is quite

clear that the slave connects fabricam both with the gold and the discovery of Bacchis,
and claims credit for his action in both these exploits.

364. Super‘; see n. v. 175. eius; sc. Mnesilochi.

365. Pandite atque aperite ; pandere, to spread open; aperire, to uncover.

Pluto, see Most. ii. 2, 67 ; Epid. ii. 1, 1Ο; 01· mors, Epid. iii. 2, 27. “Her house is the way
to hell, going down to the chambers of death,'' Proverbs vii. 27. Lydus being obliged
to follow hjs master into the house, appears to be addressing the servants of Bacchis,
demandjng the door to be opened, that he may get quit of the place. obsecro ; see n.
v. 99.

366. Nam ; see n. v. 11. equidem ; see n. v. 72. haud; seen. v. 15. quippe
qui3 all the editors have adopted quippe qno. F leck. had proposed to retain qui, but
has quo, the emend. of Lamb.‚ in his text; qui with quippe in Plautus is never an abl. or
relative adv. of place, hence quo (place) is not in accordance with the manner of our poet
nor, it may be added, of any other writer, and ought not to be admitted; cp. Amph. 738 ;
Aul. 340; Epid. iii. 2, 31; Men. iv. 2, 19; Pseud. 1274; Rud. ii. 3, 53; Truc. 49;
