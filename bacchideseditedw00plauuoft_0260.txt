200 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

and by all editors except Uss„ this and preced. v. stand as 111 the text. Ι was inclined
at first to follow the editor mentioned, but after an examination of the vv. and his
objections I cannot but think that the usual arrangement is preferable; what the learned
editor says is, that this and preced. v. are joined with what follows “nullo sententiae
nexu,⁷' “while 1045 cannot be understood at all‚'⁷ and that vv. lon-2 succeed 1040,
“hianti sententia‚” plus of 1041 having nothing to which it may be referred. We
cannot expect that in dialogue of the kind of familiar discourse found in Plautus the
sentiments are connected with the logical precision observablc in a long speech, and in
one in which there is no allowance to be made for the comic element; a great deal of
abruptness is to 110 expected, but it must not be inconsistent with the sentiments of the
character the speaker supports. There is, however, no abruptness here more than may
be expected; the old man’s feelings are mox-ed with pity for his son, as is seen from what
he says in v. 1040, and he is also annoyed about having to pay a second two hundred
Philips, as appears in this and preced. v. from his wish that the former had remained
at Ephesus; he proceeds in next v. to the matter which he sees he must face—the
payment of the money—and very naturally begins with a question, “ What then is to 110
donc 111 this affair? Ι must hasten to lose that which is to 110 lost,’' with special
reference to the words of the slave in 1038, which he repeats.
