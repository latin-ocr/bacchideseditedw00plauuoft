PLAUTUS. xi

“If he (Plautus) forms some words for the purpose of exciting laughter, as he is
accustomed to invent many such, or if he connects them anywhere too boldly after the
manner of Aristophanes, they (free-born youth) must consider that these belong to the
freedom 01 Comedy, and they must not take liberties with them. Thera, if anywhere
they meet with expressions somewhat coarse, as the stage of those times was licentioris,
they must not conceive any blemish of disgracefulness from that, but must proceed
through them as if they were hurrying through the middle 01 1116 Suburra 10 6 111016
polished street 01 10 pay their devotions at some chapel 01 Modesty’' (Dissertation <m tlte
Life ancl lVritiozgss of Plautus, from John Philip Parcus). The student ought 10 read in
this connection La &ntique de l’la'cole cles Femmes 01 11011616.

(6) The respective 11161115 01 Plautus and Terence as Comic poets have been often
discussed. The latter seems 10 1611 161 short 01 1115 predecessor in the two qualities, wit
and humour, which 616 1116 especial and indispensable characteristics 01 Comedy. We
might as well try (Horace says to Tibullus, Non. tu eorpus eras sine pectore) to conceive
6 111611 without a 50111 65 6 Comedy having neither 01 these qualities. Terence has some
refined wit to suit the delicate palates 01 1115 patrons, the upper classes 01 Roman
society, who had begun at this time to ape the Greek “culture,’' but one might read
through his six Comedies, or witness their exhibition on the stage, without being at all
inconvenienced in keeping his risible faculties under due control. In his endeavours to
reform the 165165 01 1116 Roman populace, and in his slavish adherence 10 1115 1110(161,
Menander, he has left 0111 01 forgotten humour, the main and essential element 01
Comedy. Julius Scaliger, speaking of the Roman populace, writes, Non cul {list-midam
sermonis puritatem eo confluebat, sed ad animum ris—a avjocz's relaxamlnm. Daniel Heinsius,

Terence 15 continually carping in his Prologues at an old poet, Luscus Lavinius
(Malevolus vetus poeta), who had criticised, as he thought, his Comedies with too great
severity, and who turns up in every one 01 them except that to the Hecyra. He is also
greatly troubled with his audience‚ who did not always appear to appreciate his efforts
for their amusement. They preferred, he said, boxers and rope-(lanceis. At all events,
it is certain the Hecyra broke down on its first representation. It was hissed off the
stage, and the audience ran away to the more attractive amusement afforded by the
rope-dancers. The Comedy is dull, and probably the idea of the Courtesan Bacchis
bringing about a reconciliation between Pamphilus and Philumena, the girl he had
wronged, was too large a (11611 on the credulity 01 1116 matter-of-fact Romans. Isidore,
a great admirer 01 Terence, says in his ‘⁶(hmines'’—Qnrinetiam solas· ausus est, etiam
contra prcescripta Comica, ’νων-6111165 interdum ozon malas introducere. Terence cannot give
us characters so amusing 65 Falstaff, Harpagon, Bottom, Jourdain, Euclio, Tramo,
Chalinus, Epidicus, Pseudulus, Curculio, and Chrysalus. His interminable Davus,
whom We meet in almost every 566116 01 1116 Andria, and again in the Phormio, and
Phormio himself, are rather dull comedians compared with those mentioned. He
repea-ts his characters—Dromo, a slave, Chremes, an old man, Parmeno, a slave,
and Sostrata, a matron, are found each 01 them in three Comedies; twelve others we
meet, each in two. Caesar’s opinion of this poet is well known 2—-

Tu quoque tu in summis, o dimidiate Menander,
Poneris; et merito, puri sermonis amator.
