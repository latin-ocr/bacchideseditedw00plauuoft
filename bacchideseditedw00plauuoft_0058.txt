lii INTRODUCTION.

on accent, while Latin metre depended on quantity. But if we find the same word, or
the same phrase, invariably used in Plautus with the metrical ictus on the same syllable,
and that, too, when there is nothing in the prosodical nature of the word to prevent its
occurrence with a different ictus, it is reasonable to suppose that the metrical ictus here
reflects the ordinary accentuation.”

With the first part of this extract we entirely agree, but no one with even the most
elementary knowledge of the verses of Plautus and Terence can assent to the last.
The writer is bound to show us, by the citation of verses from the two poets mentioned,
that they invariably use (1) cujas, ἠωκτναε, &c., (2) addic, adduc, &a (the words cited in
the paper), with accent on last syllable. This he has not done, therefore we are justified
in refusing to accept a theory, in an examination of the metres of this Comedy, how-
ever recently revived or devised, which appears to him nothing to support it in these
poets. General theories, if they do not admit of proof, are useless to students of
the Coinic poets. The words given above do not appear to be used so frequently in
Plautus, even supposing that they were invariably accented on the last syllable, which
has yet to be shown, that they might be taken as a firm basis for a general theory of
accentuation. The other instances given in the paper—postlzae, (ullane, «ἔα, and the case
of enclitic ne—entirely break down, even in the opinion of the writer himself.

Although it is no part of our duty here to endeavour to disprove a theory for which
no proofs have been produced, we have thought it right to examine some instances of the
accentuation of Istic, istus, and illie. Out of about 88 cases examined, including the
references given in the note to verse 73 of this Comedy, only 23 have the ictus on last.
Istic and Illic, the words relied on by Mr. Lindsay in his paper on Accentuation, occur
30 times where there are only four instances of an ictus on the last syllable. In the
passages cited at note on verse 135, illuc and illie occur 8 times, only three times with
accent on last. Illia itself occurs 6 times, and only twice accented on last syllable;
and there may be other instances of the same kind in the Bacchides. (The texts used
for the references are Ussing's‚ Sonnenschein's (Caph), Fleckeisen’s (Pseud), and
Davies’ and Wagner's Terence.)

Plautus and Terence used some Archaic forms in their verses, but also a
larger number of modern ones; and their Latin does not differ so much from
that of the best period of the literature as is generally supposed. Nor did they
write their Comedies‚ which form a portion, and the most valuable portion, of
Latin literature, in vulgar Latin. If the Comedies of Plautus occupied the Roman
stage, as is said, for the long period of 400 or 500 years, they must have been literary
productions of a high class. They must have been understood by the thousands of all
classes of Romans who assembled in the theatres to hear them. Bad or rustic pro-
nunciation does not appear, as far as we know, to be ridiculed in Plautus, unless for
the express purpose of making a character appear thoroughly ridiculous, so much as
low and vulgar expressions, or bad grammar. This is seen in Truc. ii. 2, in which
the rustic clown, the Churl, Stratilax, abuses Astaphium in fine style in anything but
classic Latin. The student should also examine iii. 2 of same Comedy, where the
same two characters are brought on the scene. It is impossible to believe that the
manner of the recitation of these Comedies could have changed during this period, except
on the assumption that they were re-written at different times, and it is equally impossible
that the ordinary pronunciation of the people could have changed, if it were not the same
as that of the liter-ary class, which wc are unwilling to admit, to any considerable extent.
