COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 141

438. {ouem to be supplied with preced. verbs, is put here to bring out more
strongly the contrast between it and paedagogo. tabula sc. literaria,- cp. As. 7563
Hor„ S. i. 6, 74; Ε. 1. 1, 56. άίενυϊηρίῂ also v. 6043 cp. Ter., Ad. iii. 3, 15.

439. Quom (temporal) 3 see n. v. 56. postulatum ; 10 accuse, complain.

440. Noster est03 not quite the same meaning as in Truc. v. (31; cp. Miles
8983 Ter.,Eun. i. 2, 74.

441. onuocatum “is summoned''; also to challenge, as in Truc. v. 62; cp.
ffsflessscfssssgaspisieiucd· 8138, 640. eho; see n. v. 197. minumi preti ; cp. Miles 145;

442. attingas ; the reading of the MSS. has been here retained. All the editors have
adopted the old form, attz'qas, for which there is no MS. authority in this passage, and
is here only an emend. of Nonius. istac causa, refers to tabula disrumpit caput,
v. 438. quando fecit Strenue3 “when 110 has acted boldly''; cp. v. 1; Stich. 593.

443. !t; this v. has been variously explained by editors. I have followed the
reading of ΕΖ, which W. adopts, in preference to Fa, the reading in D, which gives no
sense. R. and Fleck. have adopted the latter; Groetz has lta.- Bothe reads Ua· and Uss.
has Sit, on the supposition that this v. forms part of the speech of the person before
whom the tutor is supposed to have been summoned. Neither “let the master be like
a lamp” nor “the master becomes like a lamp⁷’ is, in my view, the meaning intended.
lucernam implies light, but the sense appears to be that the light is partly extinguished.
The tutor says, “the master goes out like a lamp,'’ &c.; the word at the head of the
note is used in this sense by Lucretius and Horace. uncto . linteo ; 301110, as Turneb
and Dousa, think that this was used for extinguishers or snuffers; others, as Uss.,
that it is part 01 1110 covering of a lamp or light, a sort of lantern, which, Ι have no
doubt, is the correct view. linea lanterna, Cic.,Att. iv. 3, is employed in this sense.
expletus; is the reading of ΕΖ, which W. lias adopted; armatus 01 1110 other MSS,
which R.,F1e0k.‚ and Uss. have followed, is not found in any Latin writer, and they do
not venture 10 give any explanation of its meaning; Pylades, Rost.‚ and Bothe also read
amplam& Uss. says if 110 thought the Romans said lucerna expleta for l. circumdata or
cincta, he would follow the reading of ΕΖ, but arsiletxus in its usual meaning is taken
with maffl'ster, who is compared to a lantern which has been broken, for we are told that
his head is broken with the tabula. The tutor compares himself or his head to a lantern
with its covered light which has been broken by the boy, and finally extinguished by the
father, who snuffs him out with the words. “eho senex,⁷' &c.; there is an allusion to
the surgical appliances to the wounds on his head. Salmasius proposed car-tortus sc.
exter-sus.

445. inhibere imperium ; cp. Stich. 704; Cas. ii. 6, 57; Liv. iii. 38, 50;
xxxvi. 28. uapulet; Goetz alone writes vapulat, against the MSS.; Lydus makes a
general assumption, including all masters, not specifying his own case in particular, and
therefore uses subj.; see Ter., Phorm. v. 6, 1Ο; Eun. iv. 6, 4; Ad. ii. 1, 5; ii. 2, 5.

446. postulatio; ‘⁴ charge''; cp. Cas. iii. 2, 26; Ter„ Hec. i. 2, 105.

447. Mira sunt, ni Pist.; ‘⁶ 1 wonder if Pist. has not‚'’ or “it is strange if,‘'
&c.; cp. Amph. 279, 315, 4283 Gapt. 7993 Cas. ii. 2, 20; iii. 2, 24; Poen. iv. 2, 17;
Pseud. 1216; Trin. 861. There is no necessity to write contuderit, found in ΓΖ, as fut.

would not give good sense, and subj. would make it grammatically depen. on what
precedes, which the poet did not intend.
