112 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

inci-cased by the strong language the young man uses in regard to *he feelings of the sister
towards his friend. The pedagogue also, who is in ignorance of the second sister, by his
action in behalf of his pupil confirlns it, till ultimately Pist. himself, 10 allay the wrath
of his friend, and 'to prove his own fidelity in executing the commission entrusted to him,
brings Mnesil. to see the two sisters for himself. Chrysalus, therefore, getting tired
with Pist.'s account 01 1110 sister's distraction for his master, interrupts him; 101 seeing
that she longs so much for Mnesil., he makes it appear that his assistance is not required.
Tantoztantulffi with a pun, the term used by Pist., whose meaning is changed, the
slave referring it to the sister's supposed state of feeling expressed in the previous
lines3 cp. Cic„ Pro R. Am. 45; Hor.,S. i. 59; but Cicero uses tantum 113011 111 11113
301130 (see Man. vi. 14), and so does Ca2sar. hevcle; a form of asseveration often met
with. The most approved texts of Plautus go to show that it was used only by men. The
slave is speaking in jest, as Pist. says he is in the habit 01 doing. He has full power of
disposing of the sister, knowing that she will readily follow the Philippeans which he
has secured from 1110 money 01 1110 01(1 man, for which his young master and himself
had been sent 10 Ephesus. lmm03 see n. v. 144. immo hevcle abieno Potius;
“Nay! upon my faith, Ι would rather go.” The slave repeats Pist.'s immo, so often
reiterated (cp. Cure. 7) in ridicule. abiet‘0; cp. vv. 770, 835, 1062; Aul. 562, 648,

210. θνυες all editors have, against the authority 01 1110 MSS„ adopted res, the
emend. of Bothe. It is not res and actm· that are contrasted, but erus and actor, for odio
cannot be referred 10 mne, to which, 11 admitted, it must bc applied ; res would refer 10 his
master's business mentioned in preced. v., while actor would have 10 be translated
“agent‚’' a meaning which would be inconsistent with the mention of Epidicus and
Pellio in following vv. The slave calls Pist. an actor 101· 1110 reasons stated in preceding
sentence, and the introduction 01 Pellio shows that he considers him a bad one. “My
master does not wound my feelings with his importunity, but an actor does.'’ He takes
no notice 01 rcm hene glastum, but at the mention of eri takes up that word and proceeds
10 give a reason for his unwillingness to listen. actor, is the general term for an
actor or performer; cp. Hor., A. P. 193, and so in Cicero. We have “histrio’' in Truc.

plays 01 Terence the word in the text appears sometimes 10 have the meaning of
“ speaker” or “performer ” rather than that 01 “ actor‚’' in a professional sense.

211. Passing from the actor to the play he continues. Plautus has been censured

he only speaks for himself. Etiam; emphasizes Epidicum, which dcpends on specto.
