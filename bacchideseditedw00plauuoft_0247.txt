COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 187

ii. 3, 24; iv. 3, 2Ο; Hec. iv. 49; Cic„ Fam. ix. 34, and Madv„ Gr. L. 308. que,
can evidently be used in adding clauses or words of more or equal importance, or
explanatory of those that precede; see Madv., Gr. L. 433 and passages cited and
referred to there, and more especially Cio„ Phil. ix. 7; Leg. i. 23; also Off. i. 29, 103.

938. Atque; taking up and repeating what has been interrupted by “Ita res
successit,'⁷ ἄπο. uerum ; introducing the strong contrast to bc observed between aucam
and the preced. arcem, more emphatic after the negative than scd (v. 931); its main
use here, however, is to draw the attention to arcam ; see n. v. 6. arcam ; “coffer‚’'
as in Hor., Sat. i. 1, 67; Cas. iii. 5, 45 ; notice the alliteration.

939. Exitium; “ruin.'' excidium sc.(e.r3c·id1'um): “destruction'’ exlecebvae
wheedler, said of meretrices, Men. ii. 3, 31. The alliteration between first three words
is marked here; notice also that the first two do not differ very much in meaning, and
that the three first feet are dactyls or tribrachs.

940. Nostro seni huic Stolido; “this stupid old man of ours.'' stolid0;
not exactly stupid but ‘² perverse‚” and what the slave would call ‘⁶ wrong-headed ”; cp.
vv. 549, 1084; Ter.‚ And. iii. 12; Heaut. iii. 2, 34; observe how preced. words are
emphasised by the use of ei repeating the subject and followed by profecto. nomen
faoi0; “I am giving the namc.'' For ‘umnen do or dico cp. Liv. i. 13 Hor., Sat. i. 3,
58. ΙΙίο ; dat. attracted to case of pronoun, but Plautus has also name in gen„ Amph„
Prol. 19 (MSS). Ilium, so called from Ilus, son of Tros, who built it; the name
nearly always feminine in Homer sc. ἦ Ἴλιος, only once neut. sc. Il. xv. 713 he has
already given in v. 928 the names Troia, Pergamus, and Priamus to the old man.

941. Agamemnon; to avoid hiatus and as being a legitimate form, found in
good MSS„ W. and the old editions; most editors have “Agamemno⁷’; the form in the
text is also found in Cio, Off. iii. 25, 95 (Holden)‚ snm omitted; cp. Amph„ Prol. 56;
Miles 372; Merc. v. 2, 783 Ter„ And. i. 5, 50. Laertius, of Z and the old editions;
“Lartius’' of the editors is a form so unusual that it ought, Ι think, to be rejected; the
reading in A may be fairly doubted. Resides, it does not appear to be found elsewhere
in Plautus or in any other writer ; the two first vowels in the form in the text are easily
pronounced as one syllable, and in fact they form a regular diphthong, for the second is
short. The mistake in BODF is obvious. The fact of 'Axp‘z-iov, if correct, being found
in the first v. of the Ajax of Sophocles need not be taken as a proof that Plautus here
used the same or a derivative of it as an adjective. In this v. he says, “The soldier is
Menelaus, I am Againemnon.''

942. Mnesilochus est Alexander‘3 “Mnes. is Alexander''; he has given hini,
as he has given himself, two characters to support, for in v. 932 “ Mnes. is Sinon ”; the
old man is also Priam and Troy under a variety of names. rei ; to the interests, dat.
followed by a gen.

943. abduxit3 of the MSS. and all editors except Bergk 'followed by Goetz and
Uss.‚ who have avexit, supposed to be found in A, the verb used in v. 575 in this relation;
but Plautus is fond of variety and very frequently employs different verbs to express the
same meaning; the former gives better sense, and there is no doubt about the readings
of the MSS.; cp. Mero. ii. 1, 19, 26. quoia sc. cuja .· the gen. of the relative declined
and used as a possessive adj. quoia causa, here, is exactly the same in meaning as
quoius (gen.) causa‚· possessive adj. pronouns appear to have been originally in most
languages only the gen. ease of pronouns; a form such as this clearly shows it in Latin ;
