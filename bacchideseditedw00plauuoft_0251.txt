COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 191

that the speaker intended; 2nd, the emend. is not required for the mette ; 3rd, allitera-
tion between the rejected word and pericla . decepi following was intended. The
speaker in a long monologue of this kind in comedy could not claim the sympathy of his
audience except in so far as he was able to amuse them ; he could not whine out a long
ode filled with the sentimental stuff found in the chorus of many Greek tragedies. The
only means at his disposal here was either his grotesque figure, the exaggeration of the
language, or even the absurd and inapt meaning and application of words, and above
all, the quibbling with those having the same or nearly the same sound. I have
observed that from the beginning of this scene down to v. 973 (54 lines), there are no
less than 40 in which alliteration is clearly intended3 in fact, in the first two vv. of
the scene this is so obvious that it does not require to be pointed out. F urther, in nearly
half of this number of vv. this is accomplished by the repetition of the strong letter p,
for evidence of which the student is referred particularly to vv. 921 and 928, and on the
supposition that the readings of the MSS. are admitted, the same is the case in the v.
under examination. I cannot do better than quote in this connexion the words of an
eminent Latin scholar, the late Professor Nettleship, who says, “ No characteristic of the
ancient Italian literature is more marked than its fondness for alliteration‚ a device which
is never laid aside from the earliest and rudest to the latest and most finished monuments.
Whether it be simple and obvious, asin Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, or more artistically
concealed, as in Virgil, it is a principle of Latin prose and poetry, a necessity to the
ancient Italian ear '' (see Men. ii. 3, 58) ; see also Munro’s Lucretius, vol. 11., pp. 15-16.
The slave says that he “ drove himself from that danger‚” for he was bound, and
had considerable difficulty in extricating himself (see v. 957); 111 fact, the emend, if
admitted in the construction assigned, is too tame in the mouth of a great warrior who
is expected to‘use strong language, and who has been talking of sieges and war from the
commencement of the scene. The two Atridae, Achilles and Ulysses, and others of less
importance, are mentioned. Plautus, too, appears to be fond of using comps. of pellere,
see vv. 646, 1081. The emended form seems to be generally. used by him in the sense
of carrying out for burial; cp. Aul. 149, 560; Most. iv. 4, 8-9ς also Ter.‚ And. 89; 01·
111 its more literal sense as in vv. 93, 1046, 1054.

961. Post smffltea . magnifioo; “mighty”; cp. As. 3483 Ter.,Heaut. ii. 1,
15. urbe& acc. pl. uerbi& by his words scmbfflinffi the word is used here
because it agreesrin soundwith urbes, precedss and also contains the sense required;
see Theophr„ Char. 8, εἶσι δὲ οἶ nabendum τῷ λόγῳ κατὰ κράτος αἱροῦντες παρεδειπνῆθησαν,
and Miles 1055. ⁷

962. hominem Ρορρυ11; as in v. (334. pugnam conservum “I engaged.”
The only difference between this and conflixi, preced., appears to be that the verb
before us is trans. and found often in Livy and later writers, while the other is intrans.
in this sense and Ciceronian.

963. ade0; see v. 824. un0; “ single.'' ictu sc. mendacio .· mentioned 952.
extempu103 cp. Cist. 9’7; 11. 3, 30; it is a -mistake to suppose that “in Plautus we
have always the original form ” as here, as Wagner says in a note on Ter., And. iii. 2,
383 the fact is that in his own text of the Aulularia and the Trinummus eae-templo is
found, in the latter three times and the old form not at all, while in the former, where
this form does occur once, it appears to be an emendation on account of the metre. In
this play ememplo is found eight times, and it is also in all texts—old or more recent——
of the plays examined3 the other form only here. extemplo, FZ and other old editions.
