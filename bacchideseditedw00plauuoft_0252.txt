961. nunc; as in 850; see 11. Ρ1ἹίΙίρροε; 599 11. vv. 217, 227. This v. has
been scanned as 911 Octonarius Iambic to avoid as much as possible mixing up different
spec-ies of metres in the same sentence. Spengel makes it a Septenarius Trochaic.

965. dave se promisit: “promised to give,'' as in 915 ; not followed by a fut.
where it. might be expected; fut. used after polliceri (pv. 738).

soldiers often got share of the plunder; see Liv. xxx. 45 ; xxxiii. 23, 37.

967. ΙΙίο capto 59. seni, as in 940, 943, 951. mulsum seminum,- “ mead'’; cp.
1·. 1070; Ρ91·5. v. 2, 45; Cas„ Prol. 763 Hor.‚ Sat. ii. 26; Cic„ Fin. ii. 5, 17; and Liv.

and cp. 1·. 6 with first part of this. quinquaginta; see Hon1.,Il. vi. 244-5; virg„
Aen. ii. 501, 503. m0d0; “only”; 599 n. v. 433.

Cic„ Fam. vii. 29. The slave thinks the old man a piece of lumber, to be got rid of by
sale along with other merchandise of greater 1·91119; 599 Cic„ Lael. xxvi. 99-100. In
the passage in Cic, Mur. xii. 27 something of the same kind is mentioned, viz„ old men
fooled by guardians and women. The idea- seems to be that old men are considered only
instruments by parasites and 519195 for the execution of some scheme of roguery and
deception, and to be bought and sold at the will of those who are befooling them. “ Co-
emptio ’⁷ is used in the passage mentioned, z'.e.‚ a sale or a kind of marriage; sale is the
prominent idea in this word, and the adj. under examination is of course formed from

itki The Ι11110 ideas, a sale and the helplessness of old men, seem to be the leading ones
t ere as ere.

972. uenalem quem bahem “whothave on sale.’' extemplo ubi; much
the same as ‘⁶ Quom extemplo'’ 1·. 301, the only difference being that between “ Quom”

accus. form, as here and in vv. 400, 569, 15 used with an accus, while ecce, as in v. 663,
goes with nom.‚ but in the pl. always accus„ as in vv. 569, 1165. 111 Cas. ii. 4, 26 we

have ecce with accus. With first part of this v. cp. 1·. 448. adibo; “ Ι will go up to ”

111111”; cp. Most. 1’. 2, 33; Men. ii. 2, 5; object when a pronoun may be omitted both
with this and following 1911). 111 vv. 238 and 618, however, where object is expressed,
adibo almostzmllmsuar, and in 536 contra somewhat modifies the meaning3 also in
769 ; Cas. iii. 5, 44, where meaning is the same as here, the preposition is repeated.
