Which is Greek, and consisted of three tr'z'clinz'ares· lecti, one spread in front of each of the
three sides of a square table, the fourth side being left without a seat, and each capable
of accommodating three banqueteers in a reclining position ; sometimes the word is put
for couches, table, and all, and often for the whole room. What the word in the text
means we cannot say, for it is not found in any other writer. If any such arrangement
existed, it was probably made in accordance with what has been said above, of two
couches, each capable of accommodating two persons. I do not say that the slave is
speaking in mockery here and manufacturing a word of his own, but it is not impossible
that he may be; cp. v. 750, and Quint. i. 5, 683 also Cic„ Verr. iii. 26, 65.

722. Quae inperauisth “ what you have demanded,'' “your commands’'; cp.
Cas. ii. 6, 6. Uss. thinks a v. has fallen out before these words; some other editors
propose emendd. It ought to be observed that Pist. is hurrying back With the writing
materials and instruments in his hands, and that after a little hit at the slave and a
question from the latter he makes a more explicit reply. Dialogue and conversational
language admit of condensation and omissions. Em σα might be supplied, but the sense
is clear enough without the expression of it. The fact of a slave giving commands so
authoritative to young gentlemen is ridiculed in this v.‚ and again by the same speaker
in V. 755. Mnes. also in V. 729 keeps up the same idea. imperatum bene bonis
factum ilicost; “Commands given to the good with a good motive are performed
forthwith”; cp. Miles 611. Note the alliteration here. bene; as in¹ vv. 38, 131; Miles
