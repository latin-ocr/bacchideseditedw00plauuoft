xx INTRODUCTION.

cap. i.‚ in the l‘arerya, gives at least fifteen MSS. 111 which Asinius is found. He himself
inclines to the latter explanation. A passage from Festus is quoted where the name
Accius occurs: I'loti appellantur, qui sunt planis pedibus, unde et ματα Aesius, quia Umber
sarsinas erat, α pedum planitie initio Plotius, postea Plautus esc dietus: and a MS. reading
of an Epitome by Paulus Diaconus of same, in which ⁴‘ Accius '' (us) appears to be omitted
or mutilated. Ritschl adds, that when the name Accius alone is met with in ancient
writings Accius the tragedian is meant. Why the learned editor makes this statement
immediately after he has quoted the true reading of the MS. we cannot conceive; for
if the name is not there, that ends the matter; and if it can be deciphered from it,
it must be the name of our poet, for Umber Sat-sinas can be said of no other. From
Varro: ‘⁴ Sueta fremlice ιἷνιικηιῖε et frutinni maniter mezecius vin Casina α. ,Ῑῆ-ιήιιμιῖίἰα.Η
Uss. says that not even Maccius, his favourite form, for that Varro always calls the
poet Plautus, “nam Varro semper Plautum. appellat, can be admitted here, an explanation
which leaves the text of Varro inexplicable; if not “Maccius’‘ or “M. Accius‚” what is
the meaning? “ Corruptum‚’⁷ and to be joined with what precedes, is hardly a satisfactory
explanation of the word. Ritsehl also, on the authority of Madvig, says that Varro
always calls the poet Plautus.

The next passage to be examined is also from Varro, quoted by Gellius: M. tamen
Varro in libro De Conzcediis Plautinis primo Accii rerba haec ponit: Nam ozee “Gemini‘’
nec “Leones’' nec “Condalium” ozee “Anus” Plauti ozee “Bis emnpressa’' nee Baeotia
unquam fuit, neque adeo Agyroeeus neque Commorientes TV accii titi. In Valpy's edition of
Plautus, in which the extract from Gellius containing this quotation from Varro is given,
we have here sed Μ. Aeneia,- and, according to Ritschl, M. acutitii, nearly the same as
the form just given from Ussing's transcription, and M. Hatrutiei are found as the read-
ing in this extract. It has also been emended to M. Aquilii. This reading is, of course,
turned into Maccii Titi by Ritschl, which, though a little awkward to put the praenomen
last, Uss. adopts, forgetting, I suppose, that he has objected to read “Maccius” or
‘⁶ M. Accius‚'' because Varro, as has been stated above, always calls the poet Plautus.
Plautus is not here at 911; the emendation, perhaps, might be tolerated, but such a
hysteron-proteron method of writing names is unusual. But the most remarkable state-
ment in Ritschl’s whole essay on the name of Plautus is, At ne uno quidem e.1·empl0 ab
ullo [sranmtatico hum· poetam alio atque Plautus munim eomnuwmratum esse supra apparuit.
This is said after he has emended . . . us of Paulus, Accius of Festus, and Accii of
Gellius into Τ. Maccius.

If the emend. of Ritschl were here correct, we would have the absurdity of the name
of our poet written in three different ways in the short extract given above from Varro
by Gellius, Accii by Gellius, and “Plauti” and Macci Titi by Varro; also, by taking the
passage this way, we would make Varro contradict the grammarians Festus, Nonius,
Priscian, and Gellius himself, who gives the quotation, all of whom hold that the
Comedies here mentioned were written by our poet Plautus. On the other hand, if we
take the emend„ M. Aquilii, of the old editors, we get a meaning. except that this is
against the belief of Varro, who has mentioned some of these Comedies as having been
written by the poet whose name is in doubt. The form in the extract given above
will hardly bear the change. The only alternative appears to be that Gellius has either
quoted incorrectly from Varro, or that his own MS. has been wrongly read by the
editors, and it is possible that it may be corrupt. However that may be, the emend. of
Ritschl is so far unsupported by proofs that it may be safely rejected.
