of tlie MSS.. which W„ Goetz, and Uss. have followed; Gulielmius, Bothe, R„ and
Flec . have Pollio.

213. Bachis; sc. the sister. etiarm see n. 1·. 125. forti& has not here or
elsewhere, I think, the meaning offormosns, which is the explanation of N onius; it has
rather that of animosus, with which it is almost synonymous, except that it is sometimes
used to denote physical strength. Cicero uses both words together, with very little
difference in meaning; cp. Cic„ Mil. 34; de Sen. 203 also the advs. Phil. iv. 2. It
ought to be here translated “spirited‚” full of life and spirit; cp. Miles 10, 1106,
1111; Trin. 1133 ; Ter„ And. ii. 6, 14.

214. Pist. is unwilling that the slave should forget the fact of the existence of the
second sister; their names are the same, and 116 has already said that ‘⁴ just as milk is like
milk, the sister is like Bacchis ⁷⁷; so that, while reserving “ goddess of 101·6” for his own,
and wishing to give all honours to the mistress of his friend, he calls her June. Both
are connected with love and marriage, and the names are apt enough, but the poet also,
by the repetition of similar sounds for effect, Ni nanctus, ἀφ, makes sound and sense
agree. Veneverm cp. Yirg„ Bucol. iii. 68. haum the sister. dunonem; cp.
Merc. iv. 1, 24; Cas. ii. 3, 14 ; ii. 6, 56, applied to Cleostrata, the wife, while Stalino,
the husband, calls himself Jupiter. &cereum diu-erem, Pius, Lipsius, Bothe, R„ and

215. Edepol; see 11. vv. 35, 157; ut hanc vem natam esse intellego;
“according as I understand this matter”; cp. Capt. 5643 Cas. ii. 5, 35; Truc. v. ΤΟ.

217. Nam ; see n. v. 11. ist00; see n. v. 73. This is the reading in BCD and
Fleck.; Gronov„ Bothe, W„ R„ and Uss„ following FZ, write istic, the adv„ but it is either
the demonst. pron. agreeing with (turum or the adv. istnc referring to the house of Bacchis.
fortasse (forte αη sis); “perhaps” auvum3 all editors except Gronov. have rejected
here, wrongly, I think, the reading of BCD in favour of azo-0, that of FZ. I can see no
reason for the change, and therefore aurum has been retained3 besides, the personal con-
struction is more emphatic and direct than the impersonal, and this is indicated here by
istem cp. Cic„ Fam. ii. 6; Inv. ii. 193 Att. 1·1. 6; also Varro minus multi opus sunt lun-cs.-
Amph. 501; Miles 1Ο61; Τ61·., Α11(1. 11. 1, 37; Curc. 252; Lucret. writes, Pauca ridemus
esse opus acl, &c.; and again, Materies opus est, iii. 9673 see also Sen„ Ep. 94, where quod
occurs twice as a nom.; cp. also Capt. 159-64, where both constructions are found
together. It is not necessary that the thing needed should be always in abl., though
this became the usual construction in Latin, for we have opus est with infin. ·,. Cic„ Att.
