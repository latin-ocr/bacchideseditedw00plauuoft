ME TRES AND PROSODY. xxxv

(V. 880.) “Quid illi molestus's‘? quid 1111111] morte territas?’⁷ ῖίἰι· and {llum
according to the rule.

(V. 882.) “ Si tibist machaera, at nobis ueruinz'ist domi.'’ St, here the rule does
not hold; if tibi est were written and the latter shortened the rule would apply, but in
that case we would shorten a vowel before three consonants. We would prefer what is
in the text, for nisi, a compound of Si, has the latter vowel invariably short.

(V. 883.) “Qua quidem te faciam, si tu me inritaueris''; quidem follows the rule.

(V. 888.) “Minerua‚ Latona, Spes, Opis, Uirtus, Uenus''; Opis with the rule.

(V. 892.) “Neque osculatur neque illud quod dici solet⁷'; ῑίἶιιᾱ, 111 accordance
with the rule.

(V. 897.) “Abeo ad forum igitur. Ch. Uel hercle in malam crucem”; het-ele
follows the rule.

(V. 903.) “ Castigem, quom haec facta sic ad hunc faciat modum ”; sle, according
to the rule.

(V. 914.) “Nunc quasi ducentis Philippis emi filium’‘; Philippis, with the rule.

b (V. 993.) “Pate'r, ducentos Philippos, quaeso, Chrysalo‘'; Philippo& as in v. 914
a ove.

(117. 998.) “Νο11 dabis, si sapies. Ue'rum si das maxume”; dabis, according to
the ru e.

(V. 1007.) “Philippis redemi uitam ex flagitio tuam ’⁷ ; Philippis, as in 993 above.

(V. 1022.) ‘⁴ ‘ Da mihi ducentos nummos Philippos, te obsecro.’ ’² Philippos, this
word has been noticed six or seven times above, when the shortened syllable always
forms part of a dactyl in the third foot of the verse.

(V. 1037.) ‘⁶ Duae Condiciones sunt ; utram tu accipias, uide.'' The only rational
way of scanning this verse, as it stands here, is to take Duae as a monosyllable—-the two
vowels coming together easily blend into one sound——and to shorten ιιτνάιη according to
the rule.

V. (1046.) ‘⁶ Binos ducentos Philippos iam intus exferam ’' ; Philippos, again
shortened in the last syllable of a dactyl in third foot.

(V. 1048.) ‘⁶ Et istos. Mane istic; iam exeo ad te, Chrysale ’'; istie, with short
syllable and ictus preceding.

(V. 1062.) ‘⁶ Cedo, si necessest. Nic. Cura hoc; iam ego huc reuenero.” Here it
is not much matter whether we make the fourth foot an anapaest or a dactyl 3 perhaps,
however, it is better 10 61101161] huc and make it a dactyl.

h (V. 1065.) ‘⁶ Euenit, ut ouans praeda onustus incederem ”; {medei-em, according to
t 6 11116.

(V. 1117.) “ Quis sonitu ac tumultu tanto nomine n6minat.'’ This and the
following verse we hold 10 be iambic, for they are followed by bacchiacs‚ in which the
ictus of 1116 1661 16 1116 same; besides, there is no other method of scansion admissible
except the expedient 01 transposition, or the omission 01 a portion 01 the MSS. readings,
which cannot be adopted ; (ῖς, 11116 fails. 7

(V. 1118.) “Me atque pultat aedes? Nic. Ego atque hic. Ba. Quid hoc est
negotii? '’ (itque, the rule fails3 the second (thzce follows the rule ; cst, rule fails. It will be
noticed that in these two verses a new scene is commenced in a different metre from
that of the preceding, and that a new speaker is introduced who, although in a passion,
as she pretends, at the old men for making such a noise at her door, begins in the
ordinary form of dialogue, but changes her style as she, mocking the old fellows,
