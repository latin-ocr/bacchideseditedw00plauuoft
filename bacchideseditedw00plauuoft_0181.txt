COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 121

in the way he're used, appears to have had an affinity for pronouns, and must be omitted
here in turning the sentence into English, unless it and the pronoun are taken as if
standing first in the text, or as ὡς . . καὶ in Greek-:simul atque or ut . . atque: see
Herod. viii. 643 Thucyd. ii. 93, where the constr. appears to be the same3 cp. Mero. ii.
1, 32. Epid. ii. 2, 35 admits, I believe, of a different explanation. lembum ; “bark”
sc. pirate vessel; cp. Livy xxviii. 83 Curt. iv. 23. Plautus uses the term elsewhere for

a 32111Ξὲ boat3 Demosthenes has λέμβος in former sense; cp. also Men. ii. 2, 69; Mero.

277. strigosum ; as none of the emendations are, to my mind, satisfactory, Ι have
ventured to insert this word in th'e text. Livy xxvii. 47 applies it to jaded war-horses.
All the MSS. except B, Lamb.‚ Dousa, and Weise have est rigsorem, which make no sense.
strigsorem, supposed to be found in Festus, and strissomvn, an emend. of Salmasius and
Muretus, seem equally without authority. Acidalius and Bothe read arconium, found in
a quotation of Nonius from Lucilius, whom R. and Fleck. have partly followed; they
have, however, abs tricooze. Were tri-iconem, “a shuffler,'' “a cheat,'' adopted, it would
have to be applied to the ship, which is hardly possible. tricmze, referring to Archide-
mides, would make sense, but it does too great violence to the MSS.‚and there 1s no
reason to suppose that the slave intends to say that the bark was being fitted out by the
host himself3 see v. 279. A. Palmer proposes triremem, which certainly makes sense;
Uss. has followed Gertz, and reads trgsfymzem, “a fish‚'⁷ which is found in Pliny ‘and
Ausonius. It is hard to believe how this could be applied to a ship, seeing that it is
mentioned among the dainties to be supplied for the table of Hegio (Capt. 851), and
supposing trigsom‘m, the reading there, to be the same, it does not appear to have been a
ver'y formidable monster. In the same passage we have cetum, but only to show off the
absurd request of the parasite. Virg. and Livy use pistris or pisti-2113 “ sea-monster,'' for
ozavis; tryyon is seldom mentioned by either Greek or Latin writers, and could not, from
its size‚ be fitly applied to a ship ; moreover, the slave is only describing the appearance,
shape, &c., of the bark as he observed it. The emend. is objectionable also in dis-
regarding portions of the MSS.; nor do Ι believe that the audience of Plautus would
have understood the reference. Columella (vii. 12) also uses the word at the'head of this
note in same sense as Livy and Cio„ Brut. xvi„ in a figurative sense, speaking of style.
Hesiod applies dpatdszstrigsosms, to a ship; see Op. 807; also κέλης, means horse or
ship. The pirate bark, then, may be compared to a war-horse, hence the epithet. ’The
poets, too, use currus for a ship, and Plautus himself (Rud. i. 5, 11, Nempe equo Clypea
per uias caerulas Esus vectae) has eq uo ligneo with same meaning. Also,'a sea-horse 'is a
well known monster, and “ Sea-horse’‘ is a name very often given to a ship. The editor
may be here pardoned for quoting a sentence, very much resembling the sentiment here, from
a local newspaper, describing a reconnoitring vessel engaged in the naval manoeuvres :—
“A rakish—looking craft, painted white, with two masts, left the others and gradually crept

, up the bay until she stopped about midway,” &a It is safe to say that the ancients never
called a ship a fish,but they often call a monster living in large rivers or seas a horse, for we
have our word “ hippopotamus '' froin this practice. We find ἵππος ποτάμιος 111 Herod. and
Arist., and ἵππος alone in a fragment of Antimachus for a sea-fish. The ‘first Offileae
forms is also found in Pliny, and “equus fluviatilis” in the same writer (vm. 21,

μ30). The motion of a ship at sea is more like that of a horse than aUfish‚ hence the
expressions “equo vehi’⁷ and “navi vehi’'; our word to swiin, or its equivalent in Greek
