COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 193

975. In this and preced. v. I have followed [ss. in the distribution of the words to
the different speakers, a point on which editors are not agreed. Quid, quod te
misi ecquid egisti Ρ Ι would be inclined to omit first interrogative mark, as R. and
Fleck. have done; trans„ ‘⁶ What, the business I sent you on, have you done anything⁷’·?
quod ; relat„ accus„ depend. on assere to be supplied after misi, for Plautus frequently
has an infin. after a verb of motion, and it may be omitted in the relative clause when
expressed in the principaL ecquid being in fact the anteced. or principal clause.
ecquid; see n. v. 2; also Pseud. 639. Rogas? as in 203, 213; Cas. ii. 3, 37.
Congvedeve; “Come close'⁷; cp. Ter.‚ Phorm. v. 6, 12. Gr‘adior‘‚ of C, hasbeen
adopted by most editors, i.e.‚ the more recent. The repetition of the words used by the
slave would, I believe, give better sense, but the scansion is difficult; trans„ “ 1 am
coming‚‘' or, I am doing so.

976. oratoru speaker, deputy, embassador, ‘⁶ pleader⁷’; see Ter., Heaut. Prol. 11 ;
Most. v. 2, 21, 4ος Amph„ Prol. 34; and see the meaning of oratio, v. 35; also of
orare, Trin. 1161. castigand03 “reproof.”

977. Maleque dictis sc. ›maledictis-‹sm›- “reproaches’'; almost the same as dictis
malis, v. 633; see also vv. 116, 461. comminisci; “contrive''; cp. Aul. 69, 763
Men. iii. 1, 6; Cas. ii. 3, 272 Ter., Heaut. iv. 2, 73 iv. 6, 83 Hec. iii. 1, 53.

978. Uer‘bum Nullum fecit3 “he didn’t utter a word”; cp. Pers. iv. 3, 39.
Qua porro confidentia aususfnerim rursus· ret-bum cum w ‘tacere (Naevius); sec n. v. 780,

979. conscripsi& asin 745. obsignatas; asin 744, 930.

980. idern cantent; “play the same tune’'; either ordering 111111 to be bound,
as in 804, or asking a second 200 Philips; cp. Cas. iii. 1, 9; Most. iv. 3, 41 ; Eud. ii.
5, 21; Trin. 287; Ter., Heaut. ii. 3, 19.

981. Nosce signum; see 111-ΠΜ, and cp. Cic.,Att. xi. 9. Lubet pevlegeve
has; asin 918. huben “it is desirable‘’; see n. v. 659.

982. Nunc superum limen scinditur=3 “Now the lintel's going.'’ Limen
superum, quod mihi misero saepe confressz't eaput (Novius). This is his third fate, the.
delivery and reading of the second letter from Mnes. to the old man, which he has not
yet mentioned, corresponding to the third fate of the real Troy in v. 9503 see 11.
exitium; as in 939, 1050. ΙΙίο sc. sem] as in 940, 943, 951, 967.

983. Turbat equos lepide ligneus; “the wooden horse is rearing finely.'‘
Tur-bau as in 290. lepide; see n. v. 66. equos . ligneus; see n. v. 931.

984. opus est; with infin.; see n. v. 217. All in this v. after Uolo is left out
entirely by R„ Fleck. and [sss. ; W. condemns the passage as unsound in metro. sense
and style, and marks it as being corrupt. The words are found in the MSS. and the
old editions. Editors have been rightly censured for trying to improve the metro, sense
or style of Plautus against the authority of MSS.. but one would expect an explanation
for the omission of those portions of a v. found there, and the breaking up of the
following v. and the insertion of words without authority, MS. or otherwise, to supply
the place of the part omitted; this is the method adopted here by R. and Fleck. and
their followers. The only argument offered in favour of such a method of emendation
is that the same words occur again in 987 and 989. Rud. iv. 6, 1-17, iv. 8, 5-15. v. 2,
49-62 afford good instances of the repetition of words, where censeo occurs 18 times
in 11 vv„ and it is used 14 times by the same speaker; 500 Cas. ii. 2, 15. 18. and
