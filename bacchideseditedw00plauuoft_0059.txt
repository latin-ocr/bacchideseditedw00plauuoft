ACCENT, &c. liii

For in that case the recitation of the Comedies would not have been understood, and
would not have been listened to.

Mr. Lindsay refers us to the Latin grammarians and the Romance languages
for an explanation of the accent in the Oomedies of Plautus. The former do not
give us much light on the subject; and as to the latter, we cannot do better than
quote in this connection the words of Ritschl himself from the “Prolegomenas' He
says, “Omnino tam esse lubricum hoc genus comparationis, nihil ut inde proficias.”
The languages of most importance under this head are, of course, French, Italian, and
Spanish. The accent of the first is always eitheron the last syllable 01 011 1110 0110 1101010 1110
last, and in words derived from Latin, that is, words not borrowed by scholars from the
literary language, it follows very closely the Latin accentuation; the French word
invariably retains the Latin accent. And whether the word be from literary or what is
called vulgar Latin, the law of accentuation appears to be exactly the same. Though
we find a large number of words in vulgar Latin 1101 used by classical writers, it is seen
from their French derivatives that the law of accentuation was 1110 same in both. There-
fore we conclude that the law of accentuation of Latin-derived words in this lang-uage does
not advance the theory of those who think that the verses of the Latin Comic poets are
to be accented differently from those of the Augustan period a single step. In Italian,
words are accented on the ultimate, penultimate, 01 antepenultimate, and this is the
case in literary Latin. For when we find a word, a Latin-derived word, in French or
Italian accented on the last syllable, that is exactly the ordinary Latin accent, the last
syllable of the original word having fallen 011. 111 Spanish we have words accented on
the fourth and sometimes the fifth syllable from the last; but the Spaniards did not get
this mode 01 accentuation either from vulgar or literary Latin. They may have adopted
it from some German or Celtic tongue. Spanish words are, of course, also accented on
the ultimate, penultimate or antepenultimate.

Until a language becomes literary there is no standard to which accent, ortho-
graphy, 01 111100 01 grammar are referable. And literary Latin was the model not
only for the Romance languages, but also for the Teutonic, German and English,
whose grammatical terms are not only a close imitation of those of Latin, but we
may almost say a copy from them. This is clear not only from the fact that even
at the present day writers in the former language are the most diligent, and there-
fore the best expounders of the laws of the Latin language and of its literature,
but also from the facts of the grammar of the language itself. The notion of gender
in German, and in almost all the European languages except modern English, is
taken from Latin, or at least from Greek through Latin. Certain classes of nouns
with particular endings being classed masculine, feminine, or neuter, without any
reference to seX; as, for instance, mastichen, kind, hindlein,franchen,,sb-aulem, montebon,
miimzlein siilzxnclzem weil), mensch, and others, all neuter, although they designate persons.
Also the names of the cases in German are from Latin, and indeed the whole gram-
matical terminology of that language. This, however, is also generally the case with
the other European languages. 800 Church (EssaJJ οη Dante, pp. 1, 139). Speaking
