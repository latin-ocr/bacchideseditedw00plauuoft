COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 139

refers to next v. adcevsebatui0; there can be no doubt that this form, often found
in MSS„ is a corruption of arce-ss. 'she most plausible explanation of this curious
formation in Latin is, that it is a frequentative of. (alcedo, like incesso from ‘incedo ,· such
verbs as viso, inciso, reviso, and piso are in favour of this view. Other forms, like capesso,
facesso, lacesso, pctesso, are probably new formatione from old perfect or supine stem in
ess. In Plautus we have also eapetesso (Rud. i. 5, 1), *impetrasscsse (Cas. ii. 3, 55),
expuqnassc‘re (Amph. 207), 'incipis-se or esse, z'ncz'pz’sswn, incipissit, incipissis. The verbs
enumerated above, excluding the last—mentioned, petesso, all form their perfect and
supine in ivi and itum. Ι imagine those to be from an old supine, with s added for
a perfect stem, t assimilated, and ι’ changed to e: that is, cccpits, facz'ts, lacit-s. This
is the only explanation that can account for the c, seeing that they are ί verbs, and for
ss, as the Latins never doubled their consonante except as a result of assimilation,
and even in that case they did not always write them, and much less did they add a
suffix beginning with 63, 66 601116 think,- capto,jc1ct0, and lacco were later and special
forms. All these forms in 88, together with those in Plautus, were, Ι have no doubt,
intended originally to intensify the meaning· of the verb, or give the present the force of
an historical present or an aorist. The explanation given here agrees partly with that
of Corssen, viz„ from a perfect stem in s3 that of Madvig and Roby, that these verbs
are from an old fut„ is inadmissible. Leo Meyer explains these verbs thus: capesjcre,

expressed by the so—called subj.; no form like “ payerait '' in French was ever developed. This defect,
which English seems 10 have copied, has caused great difficulty in getting at the meaning of conditional
sentences in Latin, and the usual forms employed to express them in English have largely increased it.
Would any English grammarian call ‘⁶ will, shall, pay,'⁷ or ‘⁴ will, shall have paid,'’ subjunctives? And
this is what is done by giving the name subjunctive to the forins noted above. Writers of Greek and
Latin grammars give a large number of these for rendering into English the tenses of the optative and
subjunctive—‘⁶ can,'⁷ ·‘ may,’⁷ “ could‚'’ “ might,” “ should,⁷' “would‚” of which, I believe, ‘⁶ can ” and
“could’' are not required; but a student is sornewhat confounded on turning to an English grammar to
find that the only forms recognised are “ should '’ and ‘⁶ would,’' and that they are assigned to a mood
to which they do not properly belong, while those for the subj. are entirely omitted. Have we no forms
to express a mood which plays so important a part in the ancient languages?

The Latins and Greeks, to take the verbs used above, could say si venias (sometimes found) pendis,

ἐάν ἔρχῃ, οἷποδίδως, and the verb of the protasis being a present subj. ought to be rendered “if thou

come‚'' or “if you may come.'’ Again, in si venias, pendas, ἐι ἔρχοιο, α’ποδιδοιής ἄν, neither the verb
of protasis nor of apodosis is subj. mood at all, but present conditional, and is to be rendered “ if you would
come, you would pay,⁷’ which English grammarians call 6 past tense of the subj. It is needless to repeat
that the verb of the protasis in this last instance is a present conditional, and that of apodosis the same. If
the perfect subj. is employed in protasis or apodosis or in both, in Latin it stands for perfect or past
conditional. In the case in which si veniresfflcndcres seems to have nearly the same meaning as si venias,
pendas, both admit of the same explanation. In si venires, penderes, referring to the past, the verb of the
protasis is an imperfect subj., that of the apodosis past conditiona13 that is, the verb of the protasis,
whether in the imperfect or pluperfect, in this case is always subj., and that of the apodosis either
present or perfect conditional. It will be seen from what has been said that the present conditional was

represented in Latin hythe present and imperfect subj., and in Greek by the optative with ἐι or ἅνς
the perfect by pluperfect, perfect and sometimes imperfect subj. in Latin, and aorist or imperfect

indicative with ἄν 111 Greek, and rnoreover that those moods also retained their proper functions
sometimes even in conditional sentences. It is to be observed that it was only in suppositions referring
to the future and the past that the conditional mood found a place in Greek and Latin, and the same
holds good of English, French, and German; but in order to understand its force in such suppositions,
in the two first it ought to be kept apart from the subj.—at least so far as English students are
concerned—in the third. Another fact not to be overlooked in this connection is that in suppositions
referring to the past in Greek, the subj. mood could not be employed at all.
