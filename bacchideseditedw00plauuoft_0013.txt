I.——PLAUTUS.

(1) Plautus sc. Plotus (an Uinbrian word, meaning “fiat-footed”)‚ full name
Marcus Accius Plautus, or Titus Maccius Plautus, the most famous of the Latin Comic
poets, and by far the greater of the two whose Comedies we possess, died, according to
Cicero (Brut. xv. 60), in the Consulship of P. Claudius and L. Porcius, Cato being
Censor, which was the year B.G. 184. If we follow Ritschl, who has investigated
the subject at considerable length, and who holds the opinion that the poet was about
thirty years of age before he brought out his first Oomedy, he must have been born in
B.G. 254. By this calculation Plautus would be seventy years 01 age at his death ; and
it is very probably correct, seeing that Cicero (De seneen. xiv. 50) classes him amongst
the old men, and mentions that the poet was greatly delighted with his Pseudulux,
a reference which would have no meaning had that Comedy not been written when he
was at least sixty years of age—an old man. In reference to the age of Plautus at the
time he began to write Comedies‚ we have a passage from Gellius (iii. 3), in which he
states that Varro and others have handed down that the poet, after having first amassed
money as a stage decorator, or actor’s assistant (“1'n operis artificum seevz‘l'eol'zmz''), and
then, having engaged in trade 111 which he lost it all, came to Rome, and was obliged
1ο hire his services to a miller (“a‹l circumassmzdas molas, quae trusatilex appellantw·’')
for the purpose 01 obtaining a means of living. The time in which he was engaged in
these several occupations must have extended over a considerable period of his early life;
therefore, we may fairly conclude that the poet could hardly be less than thirty years 01
age when he began to write.

Unlike Terence, who was a slave, and obtained his freedom and a good education
at the expense of his master, Plautus, we are told, was the son of free-born, but poor,
parents belonging to Sarsina, a small town of Umbria3 of his education, except from
his Comedies‚ we know nothing. We can, however, say that he was well versed in
his own language, and must have known Greek and Phoenician, if we take Poennzns
v. 1, 2 as a specimen of that language.

(2) Varro, vir Romanorum eruditissimus‚ peritissimus lz'nffltm Latina, made a selection
of twenty-one Comedies, all of which we possess except the ‘Vidulariffi which was lost
sometime between the sixth and eleventh centuries, from the great mass of Comedies found
in the Indices 01 the old literati, Stilo, Sedigitus, Claudius, Aurelius, Accius, and Manlius.
Gellius (iii. 3) says that as many as 130 were known as ‘⁶ Plautinae '' in the time 01 Varro ;
and Servius in* his Commentargs οη tlte Aineid mentions 100. (See Sec. 9.) Ritschl gives
us the names of nineteen others mentioned by Varro as ‘⁴ Plautinae‚'’ which he arranges
in a second class, because, we suppose, they have been rewritten, remodelled or revised
by others after the death of the poet; or it may be that they were written by some old
poet and afterwards revised by Plautus. (See Bitschl⁷s Parenta, vol. i., Appendix.)
Whatever portions 01 them may have been written by Plautus, they have been so far
