190 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

951. item; as in v. 947. fata; as in 916, 948. nostro 11υ10; as in v. 940.
llio 30. seni.- as in 910; trans„ “This Ilium of ours has likewise three destinies
corresponding with those three.”

952. dudum ; see what is said in n. v. 107 and n. v. 575. primo ut; all three
refer to time, se. “lately‚'’ at first, “when.'’ nostro seni; as in 229. dixeram
mendacium ; “told a lie“; seen. v. 526.

953. Et de hospite; “host” et de auro et de lemb0; the repetition of
“et de ’² is here remarkable, and gives great force to the statement, for this is what the
poet intended, see vv. 248-336. ibi se. tum: cp. vv. 34, 955, 957; Amph. 24& Aul.
190, 5183 Cas. ii. 4, 2Ο; Epid. ii. 2, 58, 67; Most. i. 2, 25; Miles 11693 Ter.. And. 149.
ibi; may be conveniently translated here, and in the passages referred to as tum, but
this is never its meaning; it is always a loeative or demonstrative adv., and may be
rendered generally, if not 111 every passage noted here, at least in a large number, in which
it might be taken for tum, as in ea re or ea re. 'Phe objection to its use as a temporal
adv. even in Plautus is seen from its frequent combination with tum itself. Therefore‚
I think it may be laid down that ibe· is never used in Plautus as a strictly temporal adv.
This is not, however, I believe, peculiar to Plautus. Signum3 see n. v. 949. iam;
“at once”; seen. v. 45.

954. larn; emphasising tune, “even'’ nec magis id ceperam oppidum;
nor had I the more taken that town, Ilium, 30. senem.

Bell„ Gall. v. 48. ibi; see n. v. 953.

956. Quom ; notice the way the poet varies his language in these vv. ; Quom here,
ut 952, and uhi preeed. v., are employed with very little, if any, differenee in meaning.
cum uxorem in reference to what he has made the old man believe (1. 912); for
although the soldier wishes it to be understood that she 13 1113 wife, yet he never calls her
mcor. dudum3 See V. 578.

957. lbi, see n. v. 953. exsolui; as in vv. 852-3, 856-7. adsimu103 not as
in v. 73, but I compare, “I liken.’' ut; how, “the way which”; see n. v. 128.
praedicari& they deelare, ‘⁶ say ''; ep. v. 810; Liv. iv. 53.

960. item 3 as in 947. dolis; as in 945. extuli ; having admitted this emend.
into the text, though Ι consider it far from satisfactory, I am unwilling to change it; it
makes rather better sense if we adopt the meaning in which it is used by other Latin
writers. Neither the emender nor those who have followed him give any instanees of
1119 compound or simple verb in 1119 391139 intended to be assigned it here, and followed
by the preposition and its ease 111 11113 391139, as a substitute for an intransitive verb.
'l'here is not, of course, any question of metre involved in the emend. W. and the old
editors have followed the MSS. Most editors have admitted the emend. ; it is easy. I
think it ought to be rejected for the following reasons z—lst, να-μαίιῗι gives the very sense
