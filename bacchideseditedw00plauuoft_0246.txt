156 PLAUTI BACCHIDE S.

“fite‘' qui sc. qua: abl.; sec n. v. 31 and 51. signum daven as in Caes„ Bell.
Gall. ii. 20, and Cic„ Rep. i. 2, 3; Phil. xiii. 7, 15. Uss. quotes here two vv. from
Tryphiodorus explaining this :—

'Amin δ’ Ἀργείοισιν Ἀχιλλῆος παρὰ τόμβον

Ἀγγελίκν ἐνέφαινε Σίνων εὐφεγγέϊ δςέλῳ.

935. exurit; subaud. is sc. “ignis'' sc. Bacchis, the sister. Ego Sum Ulixes;
Ulysses was the leader of the party in the Trojan horse, and the principal adviser and
counsellor of the Greeks in all their schemes. In Men. v. 5, 4 Men. calls the parasitus
“Meus Ulixes.'’ haec geru nt; “carry on these operations.''

936. Tum ; going on with his argument or bringing forward a new one, “next.'’
litterae sc. the letters formed by the stilus on the wax ot the tabellae .· cp. v. 9873 Rud.
v. 2, ’7 ; for the tabellae non sunt tabellae he says (v. 931) sed equos, therefore the letters
on the tabellae are the soldiers drawn up in regular lines in military order inside the
horse, as they are inside the tabellae when sealed up, and ready for action. hic Sc.
tabellae. insu nt; eitherzsmt, or the “in'’ has been repeated by a copyist from “in'’
in in hoc equo, and of course it must be taken in the former sense, for Plautus often
uses inesse with in repeated where esse would give the sense; cp. Cist. iv. 2, 68-9; Rud.
v. 2, 23, 26-7, 31 ; Cas. ii. 3, 53 Ter., Heaut. iii. 3, 4& Phorm. i. 2, 58; And. v. 2, 16;
Cic„ Lael. xxi. 79; xxii. 84.

937. animati probe ; of very great courage3 for a superlative, and in cases
where that form is not used; the sound of preceding word is repeated in this; cp. Miles
903, 1397; Men. iii. 2, 1; Most. i. 2, 19; Trin. 817. meliusque adhuc; I cannot
understand why the emend. of Bothe, sc. mi usque, has been admitted here by all editors;
there is only the metre and the sense to be considered, and they do not tell us by which—
perhaps they have been influenced by both of these considerations. With regard to the
first, the foot can only be a spondee; but then there is hiatus; if mila· were written it might
be an iamb. I would prefer the former3 with the reading of the MSS. the foot may be a
tribrach, an anapaest, or even an iamb. ; so much for the metre. Then as to the sense, the
emend. is, of course, good Latin. Bothe's emendation may be admirable: we are not con-
sidering this, but whether Plautus wrote what is in the MSS. There is no reason to believe
that he did not write it. It makes sense, and the grammar and metre are, I think, correct.
The only thing in favour of the emend. appears to be that by its adoption it is supposed
the accent would be better preserved. This, however, cannot be aimed at in every case,
unless it is proposed to re-write in a great measure the verses of the Comic poets. The
MSS„ however imperfect they may be in some respects, are the best guide, for there is
hardly a v. in Plautus that may not be emended on the plea of grammar, sense or metre.
Emendation ought to be admitted only in cases where a blunder has been made by a
copyist, of which there can be no doubt, or where all efforts in grammar, translation or
metre fail ; it is easier to make improvements in any of these points than to emend. a.
passage in which no sense or metre can be found at all, and which is generally passed
orer with the words, now become familiar to one's eyes, “ corrupt,’' “wretchedly
corrupt.'‘ There is no corruption here, and the emend. has been rejected for the
reason stated, and from the fact that neither sense nor metre is improved. And on the
supposition that they are it ought to be rejected in this place. The words may be
rendered, “and rather well for so far’'; the first letter has succeeded, and he hopes the
second will have the same result; for the use of a comparative in this way cp. Amph„
Prol. 56; Epid. 8; Cist. iv. 2, 11 ; Cure 3123 Mero. v. 2, 78; Trin.1057; Ter„ Eun.
