182 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

admitted here, ⁷10⁸ of R„ Fleck„ Goetz and Uss. I have, however, adopting the
suggestion of the last, written the passive form of supplicare (a form which can hardly be
admitted) as being nearer the readings of the MSS. ; the sense is easy, and tibi, if required,
may be supplied from the context, but the line can be translated and the full sense
given without it; the active form of the verb occurs in 1’. 222. nihili h0m0; “worth-
less fellow”; cp. 1·. 1189; Truc. ii. 3, 12; Cic„ Tusc. iii. 8, 35.

900. mest amotus3 he has withdrawn‚ “is off'’; ‘⁶ Parasitos amove'’ (Titinius).
Sine; see 11. v. 21. per· te sc. per deos inmortalia next v., te depending on obsecro,-
cp. Men. 1. 7, 1; Tcr.,And. iii. 3, 6; 1’. 15. obsecr·0; with an obj.; not the same
as in 99; cp. vv. 904, 1022; Curc. 308, 693; Cas. iii. 6, 23; Poen. i. 3, 8; Ter., And.
iii. 3, 11; iv. 4, 83 Phorm. ii. 2, 5; Eun. i. 2, 15; Heaut. ii. 3, 613 iv. 1, 31.

901. Deos inmortal is; an oath or adjuration, or merely a sort of sudden exclama-
tion ; in vv. 179 and 241 with pro, and in 411 with pro omitted. intr‘0; see n. v. 103.

902. eo; notice the change of adv. from huc, “hither‚'' to eo, “thither,” for the
place is referred to by different speakers. 1111Ρο ; as in preced. v.

903. castigem; as in v. 464. haec . sic . . hunc; for the use of so many
demonstratives coming together cp. vv. 508, 745, 11193 Cas. iii. 4, 28. Sic and ad
1111110 . modum; both to be taken with faciat, the latter being explanatory of the
former; for facta cp. 1·. 376, and see n. v. 62.

904. lmm0; see n. v. 144. obsecr·0; see n. v. 900.

905. Caue; often followed by perfect subj. with ne omitted; cp. vv. 399, 1189;
Most. ii. 2, 89; Cas. ii. 5, 24; Men. v. 7, 5; Stich. 285; Epid. 111. 4, 3; Trin. 513;

Etiam; see n. v. 125. mones Ρ as in v. 327.

b 906. Satin . si se.sc1ti.s·n‹›: see n. v. 488, and cp. Pseud. 112; Rud. iv. 5, 3. mala3
“a use.'’

907. Clinia ex Demetvim doubtless names of characters well known in ancient
comedy. Terence has the former as the name of an adulescens in his Heautonti-
morumenos. The latter is the name of a comedy of Turpilius.

908. Limon “sore-eyed‘'; in Miles 1108 without oculus, said of a mulier: cp.
also Pers. 11. simillumus; with gen.; cp. Most. i. 2, 6, 8, 36, 45. R„ followed
by Fleek„ Wagner and Roby, declines to admit the dative at all after similis in Plautus
and Terence, whilst Weisc and Uss. in their texts of the former do admit it. The
fact appears to be that the poets named used both gen. and dat., just as other Latin
writers have used them, for there is good MS. authority for both, and that editors
who exclude the dat., if found 111 the MSS„ either change that case into the gen., or
adopt the gen. in preference to the dat., even when there is equal authority for both, in
order to support their theory. There is no doubt the gen. is the inore frequent, but the
dat. is found as well; see n. v. 32.

909. Si non est3 “If one has it se. lippus aculus, not.’' nolis esse . desi-
deres ; ‘⁴ hc does not desire to have it, nor does he want it.''

cannot refrain from touehing it”; for mood of milix, desideres, preced. v., and queas
here, see n. v. (11; and 011 non queas see 11.1’. (555.
