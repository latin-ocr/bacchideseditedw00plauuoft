132 PLAUTI BACCHIDE S.

Te1·.,IIeaut. iii. 2, 27. qui is to be taken with quippe, not with advenit, the reference
to place being sufiiciently indicated by the proposition and the simple verb.

367. Nisi; ep. vv. 384, 65& Miles 24; Men. iv. 2, 52; and see n. v. 321. ut; we
would cxl-*Oct hel'efntumw} orsum· before ut, or poss-e with ut omitted. ut after spes is quite
unusual. L'ss. quotes from Ausonius, “Consul ut ipse foret, spes mihi certa fuit.’'
fi²ugi3 “discreet’'; dat. off1·11.1·, but used as an indeclinable adj.; cp. vv. 653, 656, 661;
Aul. 579 (for gen. sing. nias), 710; Α8. 174, 494, 848, 852; Capt. 268, 293; Cas. ii. 3,
39, 52; iii. 2, 32; 01110. 502; Τ1111. 1018 (10111111. 111.111118.); also Cio„ Tusc. iii. 8; iv. 16.

368. “The Bacchides they are not, but the fiercest bacchanals.” bacchae ; see n.
v. 51. With a pun on Bacchides and bacchae. In this and next v. we have the
first intimation that Lydus knew that there vvere two sisters, both of 1116 same name.
But there is 110 indication previously given 10 show how he obtained this knowledge.

369. Apage; see n. v. 71. quae hominum sorbent sanguinem cp. Curc.
152; Epid. ii. 2, 5.

370. pevniciem ; Β 11118 pernu'tz'vm 3 also in As. 132 permities B, and 111 Pseud. 364
A and B have permities, Koch and Munro, who derives it from ρει-1111100117, and Corssen,
from insiluere, give 111611 sanction to this latter form, which Bergk, and all 1116 editors of
Plautus, except R„ have rejected. It is clearly an error of the copyists, and ought to
be emended. This sentence is without a verb. but this is 1101 unusual in Latin. est may
be supplied after next word. opime; “richlyf’ opipare (ops-pm·o): “splendidly”;
cp. Cic„ Off. iii. 143 the adj. is found in Miles 107; Pers. iv. 4, 1 ; Poen. i. 1, 4.

371. Quae; acc. pl. neut., referring to ihs. d. op„ Rc. ut; see n. v. 275. con-
tinuo; see n. v. 258. pvotinam (temporal); cp. Curc. 363; Cas. v. 3, 15; Ter.‚
Phorm. i. 4, 13. ih pedes; “in fiight’'; cp. Capt. 1213 Ter.,Eun. v. 2, 5, and
Phorm. above.

372. Egone ut; see n. v. 194; and cp. Cic.‚Att. xv. 4. haec coh. gestem;
“Am 1 10 carry about these matters shut up'’? clanculum ; see n. v. 314.

373. flagitia; see n. v, 165. damna, here and dammum, v. 375, appear 10 be
used in much the same sense, “ruin'’; see vv. 64-5 and n. desidiabuia; only here,
“lounges‚” “places of resort,” from desidia. dispoliabula of Nonius is inadmissible, for
the reason that it assumes the use of r, dispolio, Which is never found. despoliabula of
Dousa is better, but it has no MS. authority.

374. adflictas; the reading of the best MSS. ought, Ι have no doubt, 10 116
restored; the editors have all adopted the emend, adfectas, of Nonius in the sense of
conaris, which Uss. supports by a quotation from Statius, “Juvencos agricola imposito
sociare affectat aratro.” There can be no objection to the use of afflictare here, except
that it cannot be employed with an infin.‚ for it is found in Lucretius, Caesar, and
Tacitus in the sense of “harass,” “torment‚'' “min’' (see v. 152), any of which will suit
the present passage. I have put an interrogative mark after tuos. The same verb 18
used in the same sense by the same speaker in v. 152; see also Ter., Eun. i. 1, 31.

375. “At 01106 you are driven to disgrace, ruin, and shame, and being corrupted.’'
probrum: cp. vv. 969, 1165 ; Miles 364. damnum ; see n. v. 64. flagitium; see
n. v. 95. adpellere . . . perdeve; 1 have taken as second pers. sing. pres. indic.
pass„ a form which has the sanction of editors and grammarians. Our three principal
grammars sanction the use of this form. Madvig says (L. G. 113 b), “in the present
