indic. in the third conjugation it is very seldom used.’‘ Roby (L. G„ Part i. 570), “ ris is
retained in pres. indic„ with rare exceptions, in verbs which have an active voice, but
in deponents re is frequent in Plautus‚’' two instances of which are given below. In
Public School L. G. 45, note i.‚ “In second pers. pres. indic. passive it is not so usual
to write re for ris, on account of the confusion with infin. act. and imperat. pass. ” Key
does not seem to sanction re at 611 111 pres. indic. of v'serb of third conjugation. 011161

jugation. And, though 1116 two verbs here together, both in νι»,1116)1 be considered
unusual, 1116 MSS. do not require to be changed, 611(1 1116 1011116111 the text 3116 30οᾶ
Latin, good sense and metr,e 111016111611 6611 116 said of the emendation. The Ρ6(16303116,

as some of the moderns of the same profession, may be fairly supposed to 11616 116611
something of a pedant in the language he uses. If 110 better emend. 6611 116 given by
Plautine 6611016161116 readings 01 1116 MSS. must stand, and in that 66661116 explanation 01
1116 forms given above is unavoidable. re is frequently found 66 ending of second person
sing. in fut. and imperf. indic. and pres. and imperf. subj. of all conjugations, and it is
quite probable that ris of the present, and particularly of the third conj 113611011, in which it
is the more usual form, was the type of all the others, for there is reason to suppose that
in the present of fourth conjugation in which rc is not found, just as the e or rin 1116
other cases produced an opposite effect, the assimilating power of the preceding ἱ or ν
tended to preserve the original form; cp. Men. v. 9, 15; Merc. i. 2, 59. But though
the two endings ris and re were convenient for· poets and writers of the literary period,
they were often obliged, to prevent mistake‚ 10 employ the former in present indic.‚ for
in a form like perdere there is nothing to indicate mood, 1-0166, 01 person, hence they
generally wrote perderis to distinguish it in mood and voice from pres. infinit. act„ and
in mood and person from second sing. pres. imper. pass. The forms of the language
never enabled them to distinguish the rnood and voice of 1116 1661 111ὀ, which always con-
tinued to be written perdere. Those in the text, then, may be defended on the principle
that the older writers not infrequently adapted their orthography to the popular pronun-
ciation, to which those before us, and others in writers of a later date, must be assigned.
Such forms in the case of act-ive verbs of 3rd conj. are not so often found. but they are
not unusual in the case of dep. of same conj .; see n. v. 461. Why ought they to be
retained? Because they have classica] authority; because they are the readings of the
MSS.; because the emend. of Nonius, in the sense proposed, is inadmissible‚ and even
were it admitted does not remove the difficulty, for R. and F leck. condemn this and
preceding v.; Guyet 377-83 Bergk, and Fleck. 379 in connection with following v. ; while
Goetz and Uss. think that vv. 3764) are only a repetition of 3725, the latter of whom,
to mark his disapproval, has inserted this and three vv. preceding in brackets. Editors
do not appear to have noticed the fact that the pedagogue, in leaving the house, is
greatly agitated‚ and in his denunciation of the sisters and the place, gives expression to
his feelings in a few short and unconnected sentences, after· which he proceeds to ex-
claim, ‘Egone ut‚” &c., and with the utmost indig nation addresses his young 11166161,

and denounces him and his proceedings, (101111 10 1. 380 He sometimes repe 116 111111-

Self, but this only adds emphasis to 11 hat he has to say, and indicates the indignation
and excitement of the speaker. As s 111 01(1 Latin was frequently elided, and therefore
sometimes not written, the forms in 3, in one or both of the words in the text, might be
substituted‚ and thereby the objection to both verbs coming together· with the same end-
ing, γε, would be removed.
