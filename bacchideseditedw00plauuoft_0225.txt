COMMENTARY AND 'NorEs 165

such forms being usually affixed to verbal roots or stems. The derivation opulus might,
perhaps, be tolerated, but no Latin root can be found with a doubled let-ter ; of course, in
some cases the Latins may have written the letter double when under the accent or when
the syllable required to be strengthened. Whether the double letter in such words
as “Appius,'’ “ Oppius‚” “ offa,” “obba‚’' is to be referred to this or assimilationis
doubtful, though “osella‘’ by the side of “offa” would point to the latter. Another
derivation, that of D6derlein‚ and approved by Roby, K. Arnold, and Tyrrell, refers the
word to the Greek ἐπίπέδως or ἐμπέδως; emp. is bot-h a good Greek and Latin sound, and
so it would not require to be assimilated if the latter form were adopted 3 both, however.
are liable to the serious objection that ε cannot be replaced by Latin 0, as this would
be contrary to all analogy, and cannot, I think, be defended. Editors generally adopt
whatever derivation suits best the meaning of the word in the context. If it is con-
tended that Latin ob and Greek ἐπί are from the same root, which has not yet been
generally accepted by philologers, then ob πίδως would be a kind of hybrid. Looking
both at the form and meaning of the word before us, and without being satisfied with
Ramsay’s derivation, or whoever set it on foot, Ι would much prefer it to that of
Dbderlein. Occisi sumuszoecidz'mus: pass. of a trans. used for act. of an intrans.

681. Me male consuluisse; see n. v. 566. ob, here and propter preceding v.‚

words having nearly the same meaning.

682. ubi; “ when,'’ with imperf. indic. dependent on a perf. indic.‚ not 011011, 11
ever, found; present, fut. perfect, rarely pluperfect, are the tenses of indic. generally
found after ubi in this sense. There can be no doubt that the Latin both here and in
v. 466 is correct, although it is unusual. The old Latin writers, with Plautus among
the number, used both quum and ubi as relative advs., as they originally were, and hence
either indic. or subj. of any tense could be used after them, just as with a relat-ive
pronoun. Instances, however, of imperfects such as this can be found in later writers.

683. Cp. v. 247. Em ; see n. v. 206.
