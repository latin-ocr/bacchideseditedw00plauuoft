134 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

376. te tui ; by bringing te, the subject of the sentence, forward it receives emphasis,
and is under the ictus of the foot as well as mei; tm· te would be the natural order,
but this would involve hiatus, which could not be obviated unless by emendation. The
reading of the MSS„ and of all editors except Fleck„ as far as I can sce, is quite un-
objectionable. The accent either of τι· or tui ought to be preserved, and as each of them
is a case of tu, it is not important which has it. intus; to bo taken with tui, as a
sort of attribute; the position of the adv.‚ closely connected in sense with tui and
puditumst, and the meaning of the latter, do not admit of its being referred to the
house of Bacchis; see n. v. 138. puditumst (depon. with same meaning as active)
takes an object, person, or thing in gen. Uss. quotes Propertius, “Valeat probro Vesta
pudenda meo'‘; cp. Ter.‚ Ad. iv. 5, 49; Heaut. ii. 3, 19. factis; abl. of cause
sc. metm-1011, if object of the person were omitted; see n. v. 62.

377. This v., irrespective of feet, naturally consists of three parts, Q. . . . una,
am„ adfin„ δια, and is more direct and emphatic than 374, which it resembles; it may
be observed that the former consists of two—Q. patvem, et, &Q Here the anteced. of
Quibus is factis; 111 the former it is stay„ dam„ desid. teque has been omitted owing
to the use of yerul. (next v.), also the conjun. and onmes: cidfinis tuos is not unlike
άιζιίίστᾱε tuos. Another difference to be noticed between this and above v. is, that the
latter is clearly part of a question.
