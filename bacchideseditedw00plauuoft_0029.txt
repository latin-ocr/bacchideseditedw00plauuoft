MSS. xxiii

dissertation (see Pareo-qa), almost twice the length of that De AEtate Plauti, devoted
to the name of the poet, can ever be considered one of them. Bitschl reminds us that
the corruption of the name of the poet, only with a very opposite result, is on a par
with that of Afflellius for Α. Gellius, so well-known both in MSS. and printed books.
The result is quite the same, for we hold that both forms are wrong, and the illustration
most unfortunate for the argument. If Maecius is right, Assellius is right; but we know
that the latter is wrong; therefore, so is the former, for the error arises in each case in
exactly the same way—from Frederick Ritschl not dividing the name in the one, and from
the transcriber of “ Agellius ” making the same blunder in the other. The last sentence of
the dissertation would be amusing were it not that it is written by a great scholar. Eo
videmur rem adduxisse, ut ultimo jam perfugio occulso nulloque, nisi quod nos fugit,
tralaticiae opinionis, praesidio relicto fortiter ex animo inveteratus error exstirpandus sit
et gratulandum optimo poetae de veris nominibus (11), quibus tamdiu orbatus fuit,
Ambrosiani codicis beneficio recuperatus.

In concluding these remarks on the name of Plautus, we may say that the form
above has been written solely in deference to the high authority of Ritschl and that of
Professor Ussing, without at all believing that it is correct. For after 3 careful
examination of the MSS. readings, and the passages quoted in its support, we have no
hesitation in saying that their case remains unproved.

HL—MSS.

(1) By far the most important MS. of the Comedies of Plautus, were it available,
would be the Ambrosiam Palimpsest, whose readings are marked A 111 the Critical
Notes. It was discovered by Angelo Mai in the library at Milan, and contains, in
addition to the extant Comedies, with the exception of the Amphitruo, Aulularia,
Asinaria and Curculio, found in the other MSS„ fragments of one, the Vidularia,
not found in any of them. Of the Captivi nothing can be deciphered except the title.
Mai, in 1815, published specimens of all the Comedies contained in it, accompanied
with a preface describing the MS. The writing is beautiful, in large rustic capitals;
but, unfortunately, a portion (Book of Kings) of the Old Testament in Latin has been
written over it, which renders the writing below almost illegible. The Old Testament
portion is supposed to have been written 111 the seventh 01 eighth century, and the
original MS. itself in the third, fourth, or fifth. It is held by those who have examined
it to have been either the archetype or a copy of the archetype of all the other MSS.
of Plautus we possess. Portions of it have been deciphered since the time of Mai by
Antonius Schwarzmann, Frederick Ritschl, Gustavus Leowe, William Studemund and
G. E. Geppert, who have, however, corrected a number of Ritschl‘s readings. The
Palimpsest is said at the present time to be going to pieceS, and it takes special experts
at reading MSS. to decipher any of its readings. Ordinary scholars have much
difficulty in extracting anything from it. But Studemund⁷s great work, T. Maeci
Plauti Fabularzcm Reliquiae Anzbraffl'anae (Berlin, 1889), to which he devoted a great
portion of his life, and in which he has succeeded in deciphering all that it is possible
to obtain from it, leaves further examination almost unnecessary. See also Ritschl,
