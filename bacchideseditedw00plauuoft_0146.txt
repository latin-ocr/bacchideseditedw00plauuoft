86 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

be remote. I think rather that limus, limam, and our words “ slime, snail,'' can, without
overlooking an element common to all, be traced to the same root.

14. Quae; the sister. exevoitos habet; nearly:e.1·er‹·uit; the construction is
used with only a few verbs, and is quite common with hahere in the best classioal
writers; cp. vv. 329, 409, 573, 1204; and see Madv. 4275 Pers. v. 2, 78-9; Mero.
ii. 1, 42 Cas. ii. 2, 15, 18, 28. “She has exercised my companion and ine and
still continues to do so ''; arm-eicos is a predicate of the object put in apposition to it,
whilst hahet brings the present more vividly before the mind than exercuit.

15. Neque haudzneqna, after the manner of the Greeks3 cp. v. 1033 of this
play; Epid. v. 1, 57; Men. ii. 3, 25; Pers. iv. 3, 74; Ter.‚ And. 205. Some think
neque less strong than nec, both are from same root, ne-qzaee3 leand is for the most part
used with adverbs and adjectives. non negatives the predicate, haud the attributive or
subject with emphasis. neque haud introduces a stronger assertion than neque alone.
subdititia glovia oppidum. ⁴⁴ Ι (10 not consider the town (the soldier) of suppositious
renown'’; he thinks it will be hard to storm. For the idea see Miles 219, 265, 266;
As. 278; Pseud. 384, 586-8‚ 766; for subd. see Amph. 493, 821; Pseud. 752„

16. mei; gen. obj. cognominis; adj.‚ nom.; cp. v. 37.

17. Assigned by R. to Pistoclerus, [sss. gives it to Bacchis. quidquid ; is
used by Plautus (1) as an emphatic interrogative (subs.)ssqaid: cp. v. 992; As. 293;
Men. v. 2, 22; Pseud. 6393 (2) indef. pronoun (subs.); cp. Aul. 191; Amph. 305,
853, 1057, 1091; AS. 315, 324; Trin. 881, 1015; Pseud. 169, 251, 574, 605, 676,
759, 924; Miles 35, 313, 1372; Men.-i. 2, 9; v. 2, 60 (where the same phrase is
used); Mero. iii. 4, 23; Most. iii. 2, 93, 112, 144; iv. 33 25 ; Capt. 467; Curc.
690, 1141; Truc. ii. 1, 42; Stich. 219. If quidquid be taken in this verse in the
former sense, tibi (see Ladewig, Phil. ii., p. 361) must be read in place of sibi and the
line marked with a note of interrogation. Two of the passages cited would support this
view, and sihi for cibi would be but a slight error of the transcribers. The line, however,
appears to be incomplete, having neither beginning nor ending, and there is something
wanting after it. In Cure. 696, also Miles 92, the word appears to be an adj. in ablative,
but I cannot find any other instances of this use in our author. Servius, in a note on
Virg.‚ Aen. x. 493, where the word occurs twice as an adj„ quotes this line in support
of its usage in that passage, aud in fact this quotation is Ritschl’s authority for the
introduction of the line into the text. But the general practice of Plautus in the use of
the word does not favour the view of Servius, and, therefore, I think that quidquid esc
is not to be taken with nomen, whose verb has been omitted, so that the quotation is not
apposite for the elucidation of Virgil’s line. Moreover, the difference in tense between
the verb, est, of this line and that, ficit, of the preceding is in favour of this view.
Pistoclerus visits Bacchis. but it turns out that she is not the person he is seeking‚ and
the conversation leads to the recognition of a sister whose name she says is the same as
her own, and further assures him that “whatever may be the result, her name,‘' (tc.
(the words to be supplied being very probably suit Bacchis or Bacchidi). Sibi, the
reflexive pronoun, can refer to the logical as well as the grammatioal subJ'ect; in the
present instance it refers to the subject offuit in preceding line; see Miles 182, 188.

18. Cupidon; Servius, from whom this line is taken, quoting Afranius, “Alius
est amor, alius cupido; amant sapientes, cupiunt ceteri‚'’ says that the old writers
