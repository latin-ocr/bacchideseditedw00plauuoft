and Latin, is seldom applied to a ship. Although the ancients, as the moderns do, con-
strue-ted their ships soniewhat resembling fish, they never, as far as I know, which was
only a matter of fancy, gave their ships the name of any ordinary fish. We have in the
Aeneid the “ Chimaera,” the “Centaurus‚'' the “Triton,’' the “Pistris,'’ as mentioned
before, and the ‘⁴ Scylla,'' not fish in the ordinary sense, but monsters, some of which
have no connection with the sea at all. Proteus is represented by Virgil as riding in a
chariot drawn by sea-horses; see Virg.,Geor. iv. 389. “Τ110 51111) 11ᾶο5 at anchor,'’
⁶· the ship rides the waves,'' are every-day expressions. And Neptune himself, the god
of the sea, who created the horse according 10 the mythology of the ancients, rode in
a chariot drawn by sea-horscs. The epithets ἵππιος, ἱπποδρόμιος are frequently applied to
him by the Greek poets under his Greek name, Posidon. Hence an epithet applicable to a
horse may be fittingly transferred to a ship. Longum; to be taken literally with
lembum; and the position of the former with regard to lembum, taken in connection
with maleficum, is strongly in favour of an intervening epithet. The bark is ‘⁴ long,
lank‚ destructive’' in appearance. mal.; can be applied either 10 men, animals‚ or
abstract notions.

latus agreement in sound and sense is intended, and old Nic. plays upon latus, as if 110
were a ship and the pirate bark were making a charge against him; cp. Epid. i. 1, 77.

there are here really two clauses—that with ut, which is always either consecutive or
a sort of causal with indic„ can be completed by supplying is and a tense of esse, as for
instance here, is essem the qui clause is either consecutive or objective. Cic. and Livy
usc the same construction; cp. also As. 501 ; Capt. 242, 548; Curc. 2183 Ter.‚ And. i.
121. Wagner would explain qui in some, perhaps in all the foregoing passages, as an
abl. of manner ; it is used in this way very often by Plautus (see passages cited n. v. 51)
and Terence, also by Horace and later writers. There is no reason to believe that ut
ιμιί 111 Plautus is adifferent construction from that in Cic„ Statim ad te scripsi, ut qni
tihi confiderem. Statim. ad te scripsi, ut qui multa α te beneficm acceperam ,· and in Livy,

the explanation of Dr. Wagner cannot be applied. Uss„ Fleck„ and others are agreed
that qui here is nom.
