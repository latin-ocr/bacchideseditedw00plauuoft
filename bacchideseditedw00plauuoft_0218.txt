158 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

perfect stem from the present were in use among Latin writers, sc. by adding v or s to
the latter. Another way was to lengthen the stem vowel. But no two of these methods
were ever adopted at the same time. The views of Schleicher. Curtius, Key, and others,
however, that in the case of vowel stems the v of the perfect was assimilated to the s of
the suflix, are untenable‚ for there is no instance, Ι think, of the assimilation of v
consonant except, perhaps, in the proper name “Juppiter‚'' assuming that the double
consonant is correct, which admits of some doubt. Forins often ‘met with in old writers,
similar to that in the text, are “jusso,'’ “jussis” “jussit‚” “jussiln,'’ “excessis'’ (Ten,
And. iv. 4, 21), and “ adussit,’' in which ss belong to the perfect stem and not to the suffix.
In most cases with consonant stems the s belongs to perfect stem. ; see also n. v. 423.

600. istaec igitur‘; refer to the threat of the previous speaker; the latter,
{iithgnzjt’² has very nearly the same meaning here as eryt», v. 569; cp. Miles 765; Epid.

601. Quid ais tu ἓ) “quasi audi‚'’ Uss.; see n. v. 76. istuc3 see n. v. 73;
refers to the orders given the parasite, vv. 593-4.

602. Quis tu es?> independent question. sum integumentum; for const.
see what is said in n. v. 402. integ.; “cover’'; in Trin. 313 the meaning is rather
“defence or protection.” The parasite says, in fact, and means, that he clings to the
soldier as his clothes, and is in constant and continuous attendance on him. He
announces himself as the parasite of the soldier at the beginning of this scene, and the
word under discussion is only a comio way of expressing the same thing. According to
some:“ scutum,” “ custos,’' “stipator corporis,’' “ satelles,” σωματοφύλαξ.

603. The emend. of Bothe, tam for tu, and of Lamb.‚ improbum es, for the reading
in the text, of which the former has been adopted by all editors except W„ cannot be
admitted. Turneb thinks “scutum'' is implied after “improbum.’' Pist. asks the
parasite in preced. v. who 110 15, and the reply is that he is the soldier’s “skin—cover,’' the
name by which he here addresses him and again in v. 606. He knows the person to
whom he is speaking is the parasite of the soldier, for in v. 632 110 speaks of him as
such; therefore he says, “He must be a worthless character to whom you, Mr. Skin-
cover, are the rascally parasite,’' servant or rascal; “parasitus'’ or “homo” being
supplied and integumentum taken as a voc., as it is in v. 606. If any emend. were

necssessaiixy, which Ι do not believe, I would prefer that of GroetZ, who proposes “ improbe,”
to e ta ’011 111 voc. case.

604. Sufflatus se. ·ι”να; cp. Cas. iii. 3, 19. Dan-uptam, W.; Disrumptum; R„
Fleck„ Uss., and Goetz, except that R.. has Dirrumptum. velim; “would that he
{3231 gimvsgtssq’lgsswgglgd wish him burst; cp. Cas. ii. 5, 18; iv. 3, 16-17; Cure. 222; see

605. Num quid vis P A polite formula of leave-taking; your commands, “any-
thing further ’' ἶ) cp. Amph. 538, 540, 9633 Capt. 191; Curc. 515, 5243 Men. ii. 2, 533
iii. 3, 24; Μο1·0. ii. 2, 53; Miles 108oe Pers. iv. 6, 26-7; Pseud. 6653 Trin. 192;
Truc. iv. 4, 30; Ter„ Ad. ii. 2, 39; Eun. ii. 3, 5Ο; Hor.,Sat. i. 9, 6; also Cas. ii.
5. 42. Abeas; . . . for subj. after opus est with “ut'’ omitted see Mero. v. 4, 44.
Her1n.'s punctuation by which Abeae is made indepeiulent of est opus, and which
has been adopted by R„ Fleck„ and Uss„ is, I believe, incorrect. W. has been followed.

606. Vaie; ..... “good-bye, teeth-cracker'’; Pist., “good-bye to you too, Mr.
Skin-cover.'' i-:t tu, vale; cp. Aul. 169; Cas. iii. 2, 11; Miles 1315, 1352, 13613
