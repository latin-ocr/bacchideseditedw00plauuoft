editors, “little,’' “weak”; cp. Pers. iii. 20, and Frlag. Nervolaria Sc. vinum subles-
tissimum.. Festus explains thus, ‘⁴ infirmos quia vel corpore vel animo facit.'’

544. Nullus est ; never subst. unless when used for gen. or abl. of nemo or nilzil;
here it is the predicate3 see n. v. 88. qui ; MSS, Lamb„ W.; quoi, Scaliger, Dousa,
Bothe, R„ Fleck„ Goetz, and Uss. There does not appear to be any necessity for the
change, which must be followed by another, sc. inrideant for invideat of the MSS. In
v. 541 Pist. says Multi . . . . vivunt, then Lingua factiosi in. op„ &c., and con-
tinues to speak of the same (next v.), after which Mnes. takes up the conversation down
to end of v. 549. Ν ullus, therefore, being said 01 the antecedent to qui, Ι have, without
reluctance, adhered to the MSS. inuideat3 see Truc. iv. 2, 36; Hor., Sat. i. 2, 100;
Ter„ Eun. iii. 1, 20, 22.

545. sibimet, 01 Bothe, R„ and Fleck„ is not to be admitted, as ne here is quite
defensible; and much more ought Hermsss v'fsnam'ct, which has been adopted by R„
Fleck„ and Uss., to be rejected. W. and Goetz, who condemns without rejecting the v.,

and the MSS. have been followed.

Hec. i. 1. Q ‘³⁴ ” Ἃ.

 

548. Nulli ; nom. pl.; a predicate, and in fact a repetition 01 the words of Pist. v.
544 ; see n. v. 88. Mnes. does not say that those of whom he is speaking “are friends
to no one‚'’ but that they ascertain from their own evil disposition that friends are 01
no account, and adds that in this they deceive themselves. Nulli, here and in 544,
and the use 01 ipsi, also in 545, as well as what he says in preceding and succeeding
vv„ are in favour of this explanation. inimicos; appears to bc a noun, and strongly
