128 PLAUTI BACCHIDE S.

somewhat arbitr-ary, may be perfectly correct as far as Plautus is concerned‚ who
generally uses etiam in the sense of “even‚” but in the best writers it may be often
rendered by “also‚'’ which was most probably the original meaning of et. et, then, is
older, less emphatic, and more of a conjunction than eciam, and is not often used in the
sense of “even’' in the best writers, while etiam, in its emphatic and special sense of
“even,'’ is widely used, and especially in oratory and dramatic poetry. Plautus uses
quoque, “also‚” but not to co-ordinate sentences, for which hc sometimes employs et and
atque with the meanings given above, although the thoughts thus bound together have often
apparently little or nothing in common. This was, however, probably a characteristic
of the earlier development of the language. With meanings of et given above cp. Cic„
Verr. i. 2& Tusc. iii. 8, 13, 24; v. 16; Att. i. 5, 8; xi. 9, 2. Other passages might be
collected from the same source; see also Madv., G. L. 433 obs. 1. For meaning see
Men. v. 9, 33.

W„ R„ F leck„ and Uss. transpose for the sake of the metre. Very likely it was some-
times pronounced dis in the language of every-day life, and it was often so written by
later writers. dis is found in Terence; dite, neut., in Va1.‚F1ac.; ditia, in Ovid; dites,
accus. pl.‚ in Tibullus and Tacitus; ditem and ditior, in Livy; the latter also in Cicero;
ditissimus, in Virg.‚ Caesar, and Cicero, but the last has also divitissimus,- u being some-
times a vowel and sometimes a consonant, the latter, when coming between two vowels,
particularly in verbal endings, was often not written at all; this is the case in 3rd pl.
perf. act. of α verbs and in some forms of perf. of those in i, also in perf. infinit. of the
three classes of verbs that form their perf. by u. Livy, Horace, and Ovid have also a
verb, ditare, and Horace has ditescere, and we have (litiis for divitiis, Trin. 682. Such
words as nolo, malo, udus, introrsum, retrorsum, ‹lea-norsum, sinistrorsum, pessum, aetas,sis=
.ςί ris, quorsum, prosa, prorsum, rursum, sursum, deorsum, sultis, and seorsum, mobilis, mamen-
tum, j unior, nuper, prudens, istor-sum, horsum, aliorsum are undoubted instances of this omis-
sion. Dicis, gen.‚ proper name, is found three times in Virg.; Cicero has Diti, dat„ which
he says is Dives. We cannot say that Plautus used dis, but we know that it must have
arisen from the older form, and that in no other way could this change have been brought
about unless that it was easier to prononnce, for the root part of a word very generally
suffers little change. It is only in a very few words in Plautus that the popular pronun-
ciation left any trace of its power on the orthography, which for the most part followed
the etymology, and there are instances in Plautus of a stricter adherence to the
etymology of the word than is to be found in writers of even the best period. To avoid
saying that the poets give a different pronunciation to the same word in different
passages, the grammarians have supplied us with the term synizesis‚ which virtually
implies this paradox. But there is more than a blending of the vowels in pronun-
ciation, for the r is here entirely omitted. This is apparent in the case of eius, huius,
quoius, cuius, which in Plautus are often to be pronounced as monosyllables. In
reference to the points noticed here cp. As. 495; Capt. 170; Miles 1359; Men. ii. 2, 69;
Rud. ii. 6, 58; Ter„ Heaut. iii. 2, 16. istim see n. v. 73. Etiam ; see n. v. 125.
