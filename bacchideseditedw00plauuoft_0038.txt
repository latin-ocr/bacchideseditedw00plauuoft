xxxii INTRODUCTION.

large number of long syllables, compared with the number of short, was required
111 1110 Dactylic Hexameter, in which five of the six feet might be Spondees, and in fact
the whole six might be such. The older poets, 111 both languageS, in this metre have
generally many 111010 Spondees than Dactyls. Had the Greek and Latin poets not had
the liberty of making a short vowel long before two consonants, one of which belonged
10 1110 following syllable, by the forms of their respective languages the composition
of Dactylic Hexameters would have been impossible. For assuming that they would
still have measured their feet by the quantity of the vowels‚ they would have been limited
in each language to an equal number of long and short vowels‚ five long and five short.
The Greeks would have been restricted to their two long vowels and two short, and the
three doubtful ones—that is, long or short. But this rule of position was nez-m· settled
either by Greek or Latin writers, and a short vowel before two consonants, which were
both to be taken with the following syllable, always remained doubtful, and might be
used either short or long as the writer required. This was the state of the Latin language
when Plautus wrote his Comedies3 and though he had few predecessors in any form of
Latin literature, the writers who followed him kept close in his tracks, and it was not
till the time of Catullus and Horace that the rule of position was strictly applied in
Trochaic and Iambic verse.

But Plautus, although the Greek rule of position had never been applied 10 1110
quantity of Latin vowels in his time, nor long after, and was never rigidly applied
either by Latin or Greek poets even in 1110 best periods of their literatures, has not
disregarded it, he very generally admits it in his verses. Our poet, in following the
Greek Comic writers, was obliged to employ a considerable number of trisyllabic feet
in his Comedies, and required more short syllables than the Latin language (on the
supposition that the Greek rule was to be applied in every 0330) 01 1113 111110 gave him,
and therefore he ignored occasionally this rule of position (in all cases), which, as
has been said above, was never at any time strictly 0111010οᾶ. Ηο did not, however,
disregard the rule in trisyllabic feet alone, for he neglects it in other feet as well,
in the Iambus of the Senarius.

These remarks are considered the more necessary from the fact that most editors of
Plautus give us so many rules in their Introductions for the scansion of his Comedies‚ to
which they are not always applicable‚ that a student is often much puzzled about their utility.

The origin of a short vowel made long before two consonants following, is probably
to be traced to the high tone of the word 3000111 or of the 1001 3000111 or ictus, which
very generally falls on a syllable of that sort both in Homer and in Virgil. But the
student is referred to what has been said above.

(4) We now propose to give some of the rules mentioned above, and to test thern
by their application to the scansion of the Bacchides,

1. “In feet of more than two syllables, the second of two syllables which should
both be short, if it do not bear the 1110111031 3000111, may be irrationally long.” (That
is to say, may be scanned short.)

2. “When the metrical accent falls on the first syllable of an iambus, or on the
syllable before or after an iambus, the second syllable of the iambus may be shortened.’'

3. “The shortened syllable must stand immediately after a short one, and either
before or after one upon which falls the accent in prose or the ictus in verse ”; and so on.

In Sec. 96 (Seager's Translation), ‘⁶ Elementa Doctrinae Metricae,’' Hermann lays
down such a law or rule thus: “With the ancient epic poets the accent had great power,
