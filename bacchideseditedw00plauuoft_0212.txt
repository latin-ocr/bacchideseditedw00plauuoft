152 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

in opposition to amici ; see Cas. iii. 1 ; hence in sese instead of sibi, in dependence on
it. habent; for putant or credunt .· see Cas. iii. 5, 263 Virg„ Aen. ii. 102. For the
latter part of this v. W. has the explanation, “Sui autem ipsorum illi sunt inimici,’'
which, in my opinion, is entirely wrong, and does not at all give the sense of the words
in the text. For the reference by hoc, the meaning of inveniunt and existumant
(next v.) are conclusive as to the sense.

549. frustrari& emend. of Acid. has been followed by all recent editors.
frustra& dep.‚ not pass. of preceding; Lamb., R„ Fleok„ Goetz, and Uss.; cp.
Ter.‚ Eun. Prol. 14 ; Acid., Bothe, and W. have the active form.

550. atque; with a word of likeness implied in Sic ut, to be supplied with
amicum. Usa, following Muner, inserts aeque before amicum, but the sense is clear,
and the language is sufficiently explicit, and would, without the correction, be under-
stood both by the audience and the person to whom it was addressed.

552. Facere; faceret is, in fact, the reading of the MSS„ which Camer. has
written Facere et, and also Acid., as in the text; all the later editors have
F acet-et. This might be allowed if it did not involve another emend. for which there is
no excuse, viz., inconciliaret, made by R. and adopted by subsequent editors. Those
editors who follow the MSS. of course take in me with Mrem-et instead of with incon-
ciliare. Bothe and W. are the only editors who follow Camer.’s emend. here, except
that the former has Facere in med incon„ &c.‚ in his text, and in his notes writes “et in
mihi conciliare’' by tmesis. inconciliave; cp. Most. iii. 1, 81; Pers. v. 2, 58;
Trin. 136. According to Festus the meaning is “comparare,’' “commendare‚’' or “per
dolum decipere'’ (in last sense Pacuvius, in his Dulorestes, uses ineilare, if this can
be the same word); also, Matrem ob jure faetwn [neilus (Attius, Clytaemnestra); and,
Quis est, qui non me spernem, inc-ilaus probris (Melanippa); and to Lambinus, whom
Weise follows, irritare or incitare. Uss. explains it by “molestias exhibere,” much
the same as Ramsay, who says that the meaning is “to unite against,’' or “to bring
trouble upon any one.” Wagner agrees with Ramsay. All seem to disagree with Festus.
It ought to be observed that the word is only used by Plautus, and that “in '' in com-
position with verbs has very often the meaning “against‚” which, taken with conciliare
in its original meaning, “to unite‚” would give the sense here. The repetition of the
preposition in the sense just mentioned is in favour of this. The meaning of the word in
the other passages cited above is nearly the same, or the same slightly modffied, as here.
Into the question of the etymology of this word I need not enter; something might be
said in favour of both, viz„ froin concilium or eon-vilium, found in snper-cilium, but it is
extremely hard to decide either way. Ι cannot, however, agree with Roby, who gives
conciliabulum as a derivative of the word before us and, at the same time, assigns
concilium to a different root.

553. Ego ita; Uss. and (ioetx following Seyffert, have here inserted et before esso,
to avoid the hiatus arising from the non-elision of final syllable of preceding word;
Miiller proposes eum. N one of the emends. are required, for the supposed hiatus is not
felt, lpwing to the v.‚ in the syllables in which it would occur, being assigned to different
spea ers.

554. Obsequer‘ffi the reading of all the Mss„ which has been rejected by all the
editors in favour of obsecro, Camers’. emend. The emend. is obvious; but Ι cannot think
that it is one of the more usual mistakes of copyists to write a longer word for a shorter;
