COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 153

and, moreover, I do not think the copyists of the MSS. of Plautus were sufficiently
skilled philologers to enable them, not alone to write a genuine Latin word, but to give
such a good substitute for obsecro, which the editors assume Plautus to have written.
XVords are generally abbreviated in MSS. instead of being lengthened. The word is
often used by Plautus, and there can be no doubt that alliteration between it and
loq uer‘e is here the point to be attended to. “BSECROHERCLE,⁷’ which can hardly
be traced in A, might be admitted if there were any certainty about it. Also, the
meaning prepares the audience for loquer‘e, which comes in rather abruptly, for
this is the reason that F leck. and Uss. have written eloquere. I can see no difficulty
in translating “My heavens! comply with me, speak3 who is he”‘? cp. v. 413; As. 75 ;
Trin. 23Ο; Merc„ Prol. 83. nemim see n. v. 2Ο8; the reader needs not to be
reminded that the form was originally a voc. case. quis is est3 direct question.
Beneuolens; seen. v. 472.

555. tecum ovavem; see n. v. 491.

556. Dic modo hominem, qui sit; Graecisin for Dic modo qni homo sit sc. prolepsis
of subject of depend. clause3 cp. vv. 781, 821, 851; Capt. 375, 552; Cas. iii. 2, 29;
Men. ii. 1, 21 ; v. 2,127; Pers. iii. 1, 543 Trin. 88, 373, 698, 872, 966, 992; Ter., And.
ii. 3, 3; Eun. i. 2, 8Ο; ii. 2, 103 ii. 3, 163 Heaut. 32; ii. 3, 129.

559. Dio, quis est3 for mood see references n. v. 9.

530. potesse; for potis or pote-esse, viz„ posse: see n. v. 33, and cp. Ter., Eun.
iv. 3, 4.

562. istuc; see n. v. 73. Quid est? When the very words of the previous
speaker are repeated, without any new verb express-ed or to be supplied for that of the
question to depend on, the subjunctive would not here give the sense intended. Hence
the emend. of Becker, which Uss. adopts, ought to be rejected3 cp. Capt. 606; Ter.,
Phorm. iii. 2, 25.

563. Super amica3 see n. v. 175; the usual Latin construction here would be
zet amicam wilzi invenires: see v. 387. Fateor* factum ; alliteration is intended by the
use of these words; as in v. 1009; Cas. iii. 6, 9. reppevk somewhat stronger than
inveni. in this sense ; the metre too requires a short syllable.

564. Qui ἓ) R„ Fleck. Quid, Lamb., Bothe, Angelius, Seyffert, W„ Uss., and
Goetz; for usage and meaning see n. v. 51.

565. Quibuscum haberes vem ; nearly equal in meaning to Qm'huscmn esset res
tibi, which is virtually the construction in preceding v.

566. All editors from Lamb. have proposed or adopted emendations of this v., chiefly
for the purpose of obviating hiatus. In the text given here there is no hiatus at the end
of fourth foot, where the division of the v. occurs, and the fact of the accent and caesura
being on the final syllable of tute prevents its elision. But though I cannot accept any
of the emendations on this head, with which Ι need not trouble the student, something
ought to be done in respect to the sense. With this view, seeing that nisi cum illa
of preced. v. cannot be taken with amave, an interrogative mark ought to be put at
end of that v„ and this taken as a new question. If both vv. are combined, and occiperes
amare (cp. Cist. 69, 96) taken with nai cum illa, the second of these words ought to be
omitted and illam written for villa. Ι would prefer the former expedient as the less
violent of the two; and as regards sense I cannot see any difficulty. Professor
Sonnenschein. in a note to his review of the “Essays of Studemund‘s Pupils‚” in the
