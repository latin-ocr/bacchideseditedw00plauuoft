164 PLAUTI BACGHIDES.

cp. Cure. 500; Pala-em ac cimices An pedes! (Livius Andronicus, Gladiolus). Also‚
Nonius quotes a line from the lost play, Vidularia, “Ubi quamque pedem videbat, sub-
furabatur omnis,'' where the word is fem„ and taken to be from a nom. pedis: 10 Cure.
it is assumed to be pes. The word at the head of the note may be taken as a dat. pl. of
either of these forms, and may be translated “vermin.'’ tormentum, for tormento of
the MSS„ has been admitted in preference to termento of Festus, which has been
adopted by all editors (Brachmann proposes termentum) except some of the old editions,
which have tormenta, but the dat. cannot be admitted in connexion with the explanation
given here of the whole v., and it ought to be observed that Plautus very often uses
nom. where a dat. of the predicate might be expected; see v. 934. The whole v. may
be rendered, “There has been no mode of torture by vermin compared with the way I
shall assail my 1naster.'' The slave clearly means that the old fellow frequently suffers
from this kind of torture, and that his own mode of attack will be something of the
same kind, but more severe. The word tormentum, Ι think, is intended by Plautus
to have here a double meaning. As the slave is talking about a siege, it is very
appropriate in its litei-al meaning of “ engine,” and also as the mode of torture mentioned
above. Tormenta is found in all the MSS. It is, too, very natural in the mouth of a
slave, for though Chrysalus may never have been subjected to this mode of torture,
employed for the purpose of extorting evidence from slaves, as belonging to that class,
he had, no doubt, a deep sense of its severity. praeut sc. prae quo, before which, or
compared with which, for prae implies comparison, and in fact prae lmc tormento ut or
quo, which gives the sense, may be substituted for above, prae-ut being really two
words, and a form similar to sicut, which often occurs; cp. Amph. 370; Men. ii. 3, 3o;
v. 5, 33; Mero. ii. 4, 2; Miles 203 Ter.‚Eun. ii. 3,10. It will be observed that
Chrysalus in this scene, just like a modern elown or low comedian‚ is striving to make
himself and the characters with which he is associated appear ridiculous; in v. 935 he
calls himself Ulysses, but as he is engaged in a great siege he must be a great warrior,
and so in 941 he is Agamemnon; he has just told us in this v. how that renowned warrior
is going to “ storm'' and attack the citadel at every point. Of course if pedibus were
rendered “ stalks,'’ as some have supposed it ought to be, tei-meum, if admissible‚ with the
meaning detrimento assigned by Festus, would require to admit of translation. Ι cannot
see how it can have any meaning; the verb has no nom.‚ and being impers. one would
expect its subject to be the clause following. This it certainly is not. We have no authority
whatever for a word termentum with the meaning of detrimentum (for it can hardly be
read in A) except Festus. Why is it not written trimentzmi, as detrimentum from the
same root is written? A plausible answer would be that ternwntimt is pronounced with
first syllable long and trimentum would have the first short. It might, however, be
admitted as a genuine Latin word if it were possible to get at the sense. As, in my
opinion, it fails in this particular it ought to be rejected. Even detrimentum 110011
would give no meaning. The word mentioned has only, however, that meaning in
very late writers, and there is no evidence to show that Plautus ever used it in the sense
proposed. To take pedibus, “feet,⁷' either with termento or tormento would only give, Ι
believe, nonsense.

926. This v. and the preced., if joined, as I believe they ought, clearly refer to
what he has already done, the rest to the main siege for the second two hundred
Philips mentioned in v. 966. expugnaui; here in its literal sense, as in 924, although
it has aurum for its object. amantizamatori: “lover'’; cp. vv. 191, 230, 348, 390,
6-17; Cas. iii. 4, 283 Merc., Prol. 81 ; and see n. v. 472. erili; see n. v. 168.
