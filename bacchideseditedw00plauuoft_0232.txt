Ne exsurgatis is not for an imperative, but depcnds on fite-ite, v. 750. For exsuv-
gatis cp. Most. ii. 1, 29; also Miles 81; Most. v. 1, 53.

766. NIrni0; abl. of nimius: used as an adv„ sc. nimium, and in the same sense
as in Truc. iv. 1, 6. It is not improbable that nimio of the MSS. is for m'mium, for m
is generally omitted and the older ο after another vowel is frequently found in MSS.
and texts of old writers for the later ιι. Either nimium ought to be written here or
nimio taken for it in sense, for the explanation given n. v. 71 about comparatives cannot
in this instance apply. magnae diuidiae; “grief’'; may bc either gen. or dat.; for
latter word see v. 1029; Cas. ii. 2, 11; Mero. iii. 4, 34 ; Stich. 19; True. iv. 4, 3; also

‘⁶ fetch the gold'’; see v. 323, and cp. Ter., Phorm. iv. 4, 14. Α more usual expression
is aurum auserre: see vv. 298, 800, 819-20. This, however, implies that he who takes
the gold has no legal right to it. Of course, this and preeed. v. are spoken in irony.
