xlviii INTRODUCTION.

and that, on the other hand, Anapaests and Tribrachs are much more numerous in the
latter metre. Have Anapwsts and Tribrachs a Trochaic rhythm? No one would say
so. Then why use them in a metro in which the Trochaic rhythm is so pronounced, so
much more frequently than in one in which the rhythm appears to agree with their own ‘2
In the 40 lines of the Acharnians of Aristophanes, commencing at verse 676, &c.‚ which
are Trochaics‚ the poet appears to have generally used Spondecs in addition to the
proper feet in the free positi0ns; 01100 only a Tribrach is found, in second foot, whilst
in the restricted positions there are only 7 Tribrachs, and no Dactyls or Anapaests.
In Iambic Trimeters he employs about the same number of Anapaests as Terence
(000 Achai-n. 1-403 Ter. And. 1-40), but fewer Dactyls and more Tribrachs. Terence uses
more Anapaests and Dactyls than Plautus in the Senarius, and about an equal number
of Tribrachs. This at least holds good' 111 Am Ι)” ια abov‚e compared with 799, &c.‚ of the
]›' acdwels. Plautus has a larger number of Spondees. In the Septenarius he has
rather more Tribrachs about the same number of Spondees, and fewer Anapaests and
Dacty ls than Tei-,enee In the Senarius, Plautus uses more ir··1egula1 feet in the 01011
places than 111 the odd, and 111 1110 Septenarius 111010 Anapaests and Tribrachs‚ and fewer
Spondees in the odd or restricted places than in the even.

From the foregoing facts we conclude that the Latin 0011110 poets employed the
Spondee and Dactyl in the 8011011110 more frequently than the Anapaest and Tribrach,
for the purpose of relieving the monotony of the Iambic rhythm, and not because the
rhythm 01 111000 feet was the same as that of the usual foot of that metre, which was
not the fact, and that in the Septenarius they used the Anapaest and Tribrach oftener
than in the Senarius for the same reason.

(10) Synizesis. This figure has frequently been made 0101101)Ιο 111 1110 scansion
of this Comedy‚ often to avoid the shortening of a vowel coming before two consonants
in some other syllable in the line, but never where any consonant except Ιι or v inter-
venes between the two vowels. 200 00000 have been noted in the Bacchides. On 163
of these the ictus falls, or they occur in Caesura3 frequently both are found in the
contractcd syllable. Rather more of these contractions are in the Septenarius than in
the 8011011110; 6 111 40 111100 examined and ι) 111 1110 001110 number of 80110111.

Hiatus. About 78 00000 111 this Comedy; all' m Caesura 01 under the ictus, very
frequently both, or 111111 0 change of 01101101 01· inte1·punetion‚with the exception of
about 12. Ι11 111000 exceptions, 0011101111100,1110 1011·οΙ being long, may be 011011011οᾶ at
the end 01 0 1001. They are in 1··01000 59, 99, 404, 430, 486, 545, 632, 639, 723, 736;
011 Τ1·00110100. They are all short vowels ending a scot, except 99, 404, 430, 545, 723,
736, which might be shortened so as to weaken the effect of the Hiatus and render it
scarcely perceptible. The two other cases are verses 26 and 1202. The former is at the
end of a Bacchius, and the latter, milri, at end of a Dactyl or Spondee in Anapaestic
metre. 1194 may be mentioned (Anapaestic), in which ta must be shortened in Hiatus
to form the first syllable of an Anapaest. Hiatus could be avoided by scanning the line
as an Iambic verse, which might be done.

There are 45 instances in this Comedy of the non-elision of m before a vowel.
All these are excusablc except 4, on the ground that there is either a change of speakers,
interpunction, Caesura, or an ictus falls on the syllable. The exceptions are eum in
verse 246, at end of Dactyl or Spondee in a 8011011110, and eum at end of Tribrach in
verse 381, 0 Septenarius, and sodalem, a Trochee, in verse 492, also a Septenarius3 the
