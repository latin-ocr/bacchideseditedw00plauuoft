118 PLAUTI BAOCHIDES.

oteqare, next v.; Continuo: ertempw, vv. 258, 260, and again vv. 288, 297, 301, and ilico,
300.

257. twiobulurm a three-obol piccezhalf a drachma, about 4=}d. of our money,
but it is put here for a trifle, a penny. “ He asserted that he did- not owe you a penny.’'
The Greek form τριώβολον is found in Aristophanes, Thucydides, and Xenophon, and all
the compounds cf ὀβολός, as names of Greek coins, are written with ω. The 0 in Latin is
also long, and is wrongly marked short in some Latin dictionaries; cp. Rud. iv. 3, 111;
1’. 2, 43, 72; v. 3, 11; Poen. i. 2, 171; ii. 17; iv. 2, 46.

258. Continuo; appears to have originally contained a notion of the order of
successive events, in the narration of which it implies that the one followed the other
without a break; hence one verb is found emphasized by ilico or ‹ni-templa, followed by
another with continuo,- cp. vv. 297, 371, 6853 Amph. 8733 Cist. ii. 1, 10; ii. 3, 35; Epid.
ii. 2, 84; iii. 3, 43; iv. 1, 41; Capt. 128. antiqu0m; “old’'; cp. Amph. 471; Most.
ii. 2, 45; Poen. v. 2, 18 (not exactly the sanie meaning).

259. senem; “aged.’'

260. extemplo: has reference to time; cp. vv. 288, 683 ; Epid. iii. 2, 25 ; iii. 3, 43;
Cist. i. 3, 31ς Capt. 122; Merc.,Prol. 61, 67. sumbolum3 “token''; what it was
may be seen from Pseud. 55, 57, 648-9, 716-17, 753, 1092, 1116; cp. vv. 262-3. In this
v. and the passages referred to it appears to have been a scal—a square piece of wood
or metal, tessera liqnaa‚i1npressed with the image of some one on the wax ; but sumbolum
being a general term, can refer to any token agreed on by two parties which may be
easily recognised when presented by a third. The old man does not appear to have lent
the gold to his friend at Ephesus, but only entrusted it to him for safety, and therefore
he did not require to take any great precautions to ensure its delivery to his son when
sent for it. The slave speaks of Mnesil. having been charged with tampering with
the seal (vv. 263, 265)——a charge which would lose its force were any other meaning
assigned to sumbolmn than that given here. Besides, in Pseud. 55-56, where a regular
bargain is stated to have taken place and money due, the presentation of the seal is at
once admitted as evidence of liability to stand by the agreement. Other methods of
demanding debts to which Plautus does not refer do not require to be noticed. The
word appears to be either mas. or neut. in Plaut.; tes-sera hospitalis (half of which was
retained by each party) in Poen. v. 2, 87 is a different thing. In Ter., And. 61 ; Eun.
iii. 4, 23 iii. 5, 59, it means “ contributions.’'

261. tute; see n. v. 108.

262. sumbolum; see n. v. 260. mnu “he begins”; cp. “infit postulare,”
Plautus; “erigere infit,'‘ Lucret. v. 1208. lt is used by the poets, except that it is
found in Livy i. 23, 28; iii. 71. From the fact that Virg., Aen. xi. 212, has “ita farier
infit,'' and Lucan, Phars. ii. 241, “Fari his vocibus infit,” it is not likely that in
derivation it has any connection with sari itself; cp. also As. 340; Merc. ii. 1, 25;
Ru‹1.,Pr01. 51, 533 Virg.‚ Aen. v. 7083 x. 86ος xi. 30l; xii. 10. A verb of speaking,
if not expressed, must always be supplied in infinit. mood. Latin writers generally use
incipit in the same sense3 cp. Virg„ Bucol. iii. 58; Hor., S. i. 9, 21 ; 11. 3, 6; ii. 6, 79;
Sall.,Jug. 109. Plautus uses occipio, generally in perfect, with a verb of saying; cp.
Curc. 433 Poen. ii. 24; Stich. 579; Trin. 162, 897.
