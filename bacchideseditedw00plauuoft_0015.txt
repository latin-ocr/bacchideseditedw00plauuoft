PLAUTL‘s. ix

more discreet members of society. Being a writer of Comedy, he is entitled to more
liberties than are allowed in other species of poetry—libcrties which, as far as wc can
judge, he uses with wisdom and moderation, and never allows himself to wander into
the regions of the purely obscene, as the writers just mentioned, who had no such plea
for their defence.

This edition not being intended for scholars‚ in the special application of that term,
a translation of an extract from Parcus bearing on this part of the subject is here
given :-—-

“But dismissing these despisers of Plautus, 1 shall also say something of those
who are not ashamed to assert that Christian youth are very greatly corrupted by the
reading of the Comedies of Plautus; likewise that they are redolent of obsolete
antiquity3 and, in short, that the language of Plautus is corrupting and absolutely leads
to vice, therefore it is to be neglected, and students of polite literature are to be
altogether restrained from the reading of it. To speak first of the objectors mentioned,
I am not ignorant that St. Augustine very strongly detested all that part of his life
which he spent in reading heathen authors. Nor can I even deny that wanton harIots,
grasping panders, greedy parasites, profligate young men and foolish old ones, hoary
rakes and deceitful slaves, effeminate morals worthy of Marseilles or Tarentum—in
short, jokes not witty but coarse, as if brought from the Suburra, Velabrum, or Tuscan
Alley, are frequently introduced in the Comedies of Plautus. But what then? On this
account is that writer, who has been continually before the eyes and in the hand and the
lap of the most learned men for so many years, for so many ages, to be dashed from
the hands of our more well-bred youth‘.> By no means. For even if there is anything
disgraceful in them which may ensnare the unwary, still nobody will be so inconsiderate
a judge as not to say and feel that that is to be charged, not to Plautus, but to Comedy.
But yet not even to this will he acknowledge that it can be charged who has considered
that Comedy is the imitation of the mode of life, the mirror of the habits of society,
and the image of truth. Certainly in it good principles contend most of all with bad-
in short, excellent hopes with general hopelessness; and therefore very excellent
qualities are, as it were, overpowered by most disgraceful vices, so many and so great.
This being so, that class of people, accustomed to get into a passion with Comedy for
the reason that vices and depraved morals are comprised therein, seems to me to
resemble those females who, although unseemly of themselves and endowed with ill
looks, get angry with their looking-glasses for not reflecting a beautiful image of them.
Wherefore, to those who are not only indignant at wantonness, roguery, vice, disgrace,
lust and avarice placed before them as in a mirror‚ but even burn with anger and
indignation on that account, Ι give the advice, that they should avoid wrong-doing;
Ι am certainly persuaded that then at length they will be exempt from all the fiercer
bite of Comedy. And if Plautus ought not to have been read for the reason that he
touches on vices, who, pray, would have collected into a whole the Iliad and the
Odyssey of Homer, abounding, even as they did at that time, with the vices and crimes
of different people‘? Who would ever have read them? For, not less than our Plautus,
he rather frequently reproves wrong-doing; that is to say, the shameful conduct of
Paris, Circe, Calypso and Venus, the bad behaviour of the Suitors, and other disgraceful
acts. Would Augustus have ever held Virgil in so great honour, who treats of the
scandalous intrigue between AEneas and Dido ἱ) Nor would the Comedies of Aristophanes,
quite shameful in some parts, have been repeatedly read with so great diligence and
