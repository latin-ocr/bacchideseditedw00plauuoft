924. pedibus, for pediculis: none of the editors, except Uss. and Goetz, has
admitted this reading, which is that of the MSS, and even the former has marked it as
corrupt; as none of the other emends. of the different editors can be accepted, it is
evidently the best, and being the reading of the MSS. ought to have received some
explanation. Here an attempt has been made to explain the reading as it stands; for
if it is inexplicable, what is the use, it may be asked, of printing it as part of the text ἰ)
