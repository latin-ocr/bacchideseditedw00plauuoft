disfigured as to be condemned by that ancient critic, and thereby considered unworthy
of being included among the genuine Comedies in the Varronian list. The same
scholar gives a third list of thirteen; that is, fifty-three so-called Plautine Comedies, of
which forty are recognised by Varro as Plautine, twenty-one of which he considered
genuine, and written entirely by Plautus.

(3) The twenty Comedies of Plautus are always arranged in MSS„ and old
editions in alphabetical order, without reference to the time at which they were
severally written. The Bacchides, however, instead of occupying its proper place,
according to that order, after the Aulularia, has been inserted after the Epidicus.
That it originally occupied its proper place is clear from the fact that a portion both of
the end of the Aulularia and of the beginning of the Bacchides has been lost. It is
also clear that it has been removed from its place by some scribe, at an early date, who
was led away by the mention of the Epidicus in v. 211-Etiam Epidicum, quam egm
fabulam aeque ac me ipsum amo. There is another reason why the two Comedies may
have been inserted together: they are very much alike, and both good. An old man in
each has been swindled out of a sum of money by a elever slave, to give to his son to
purchase a music-girl in the one case, and to give to a meretrix in the other. A captain also
appears in both to claim the girl. The old man is also twice deceived in both Comedies.

(4) Of Bacchides, or The &istm-s, as it is sometimes called, it may be said that
it is one of the best, if not the best, of the Comedies of the great Latin Comic‚ and also
one of his latest. Ritschl is of the opinion that it must have been written about
B.C. 188, or perhaps latei-3 that is, three or four years before the poet's death. And
even if vv. 51, Quia, Bacchi& bacchas metim et bacchanal tumn. and 368, Bacchides uon
Bacchides sed hacc-ha? sunt acerrzlmoe, refer to the suppression of the Bacchanals in
B.C. 186, the date of the writing or of the representation on the stage of this Comedy
would be brought to within two years of his death. Ritschl, however, thinks that the
latter verse refers only to the orgies and irregularities of these Bacchanals‚ which were
notorious, and well-known in the time of Plautus, without specially alluding to their
suppression. The student is referred, for an elaborate history and criticism of this
Comedy, to Ritschl’s Parerya, vol. i.‚ Dis. vii„ and Opil-sc. vol. ii. 6.

(5) One has grown accustomed, when reading a book, ancient or modern, treating
of the Comedies of Plautus, to expect to find something about the poet's violation of
the rules of decorum—about his gmssness, roughness, and even indecency. We do not
think such charges are at all pertinent; and, therefore, they do not require to be
refuted, seeing that he has been translated by a lady, Madame Dacier, and that he was
so great a favourite with St. J erome, the most learned of the Latin Fathers, who was
the first to give us a translation of the Holy Scriptures. This poet generally follows
the old proverb—Ficus lieux, lislonem liglo‘nem vocat. Lessing, no mean judge of
dramatic literature, tells us, “Theophrastus, Plautus and Terence were my world,
which Ι studied with delight within the narrow limits of a monastic school. How
gladly should 1 wish these years back! the only years in which I have been happy.’'
In no part of his twenty Comedies can there be found such “ Stoff ‘' as one may read in
Ovid, Juvenal, Martial, Catullus, even Horace, and, we may add, Aristophanes.
Plautus was no Court poet, but rather an ancient Shakespeare writing for the stage
and the amusement of all classes of his countrymen. Above all things, it should never
be forgotten that he was a Comic poet, and was obliged to use language suitable to such
characters as are never taken by the writers of any nation as the representatives of the
