84 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

from sixteen years of age upwards, but Cicero applies it, in much the same way as j ιιι-01110,
to men of forty. For its frequent use in Plautus, cp. 11. 63, 418, 588, 812; Α3. 133,
334, 826; Epid. i. 1, 1; iii. 4, 4, 8, 21, 27; Capt.105,140; Cure. 399; Most. iv. 3, 12.
Men. ii. 2, 11, 15; iii. 2, 29, 33, 41; Ρο1·3. iv. 4, 109; Ροο11. 1. 5, 28; Pseud. 615,

111111 comparatives and with 101113 implying comparison, “multo me antevenit,’' Ter.,
Trin. 546; with the positive even, “maligna multo'' (Ter.); for lonjse with a super-
lative, “multo optimus'’ (Lucil). Multum is sometimes used instead of it with a
comparative, “multum improbiores'‘ (Most. iii. 2, 137). In Men. v. 6, 13, ‘multo is
accompanied 111111 massis and compar. For multum with verbs and adjectives, cp. Trin.
68; Aul. 1243 Stich. 216; Capt. 272. Ecthlipsis is here neglected. The caesura, and
the fact of the word being a proper name, which requires to be fully pronouneed‚ lessen
the effect of the poet's non-observance of this figure. Ritschl overcomes the difficulty
by transposing the words. anteit ; see 1. 1085 of this play; Amph. 643; Cas. ii. 3, 9;
Cist. ii. 1, 3, for the different forms of this 10111. Antidit occurs in the codices, but in
a great number of instances the d has been inserted by editors against the authority of
the MSS. to avoid hiatus.

7. Hiatus after qni. ilico; “on the spot‚'' in that plaee; “in eo loco ’¹ (Nonius).
L'ssing quotes Naevius, “Septimum decimum annum ilico sedent''; Accius, “Ilico,
inquam, habitat quisquam propius '’? (Eurysaces); Caecilius, “Manete ilico ’² (Nothus
Nicasio); Cassius Hemina, “et tum quo irent, nesciebant; ilico manserunt’'; “His
persuadetur, ilico manerent’'; “Pars ilico manet''; cp. 11. 300, 1138; Trin. 608,
627, 1059; Pseud. 490, 533, 536; Amph. 213, 239, 630, 707, 792, 858; Το1·., Ηο0. v. 3,
26; Ad. ii. 1, 23 Most. 11. 1, 26, 29; 1. 2, 1, for the usage of this word in the
Comic writers. Its meaning in this 10130 13, 111 my opinion, as strongly supported by
the passages in Trin. 627, and Ter., Ad. ii. 1, 2, as by the others cited above3 see also
Aul. 109, 701 ; Stich. 90, 557, 725; Cure. 81, 349, 363, 687.

Bacchis proceeds 111111 her speech to the old man. Ritschl gives the lines to
Cleomachus, the soldier, but it is rather against his arrangement, that this character
does not again appear until we come to the eighth Scene of the fourth Act, in 11111011
sixteen or 3010111001] 111103 are assigned him ; he then makes his exit, and does not return.
The whole development and action of the Bacchides are carried on by the two sisters, two
slaves, 1110 01(1 111011 and their two sons. The soldier is only an instrument in the hands
of Chrysalus, by whose artful manceuvring, together With his own threats, he obtains a
promise from the old man of the two hundred Philippians Which he demands for the
sister, his 11110, as he calls her.

We 0110 the fragments of this play to the great industry and exertions of Ritschl,
by whom they 11010 collected and brought to light; their proper place is at the be-
ginning, which, with the exception of these, is lost. They are, no doubt, portions of
different soenes, but, with the exception of 1. 11, 1110 reply of the old man 10 Bacchis,
they ought to be assigned to Bacchis, Pistoclerus and the sister, as the first extant scene
of the play, consisting of seventy-four lines, has been by all editors on the authority
of ltheBGreek letters Α, Γ, Ε, representing respectively these characters in the
coiex

⁸ In these Notcs Bacchis, the Samiam, is always called “the sister.”
