the Spondees and Trochees composing it, we shall have a fair idea of how the same
sentence would sound in the ordinary talk of that period. This theory, first definitely
formulated, so far as I know, in some articles of mine in the ‘Classical Review' of
October—November, 1891, will, if it stand, modify, '' 810. The subjunctive inood is very
necessary at the end of this extract. The theory cannot stand, for Plautus himself, the
very highest authority on the Metres and Prosody 01 1110 own Comedies, has disprov ed
it over and over again in the lines of this Coniedy cited above. The theory itself is
Bentley’ s. Its ieiteration i'n this paper of Mr. Lindsay 1001110 vividly to one' s inind the

lines of J 111 enal: —

. atque eadem cantabit versibus iisde1n3
Occidit miseros crambe repetita inagistros.'

But we need not enquire 11 hether Dr Bentley 01 Mr. Lindsay 11 as the inventor, for the
theory is impossible. Bentley himself says, “ for, in the first and third Dipody, irregular
accentuation was allowed, seeing that without such a privilege both Latin comedy and
tragedy should despair 01 ever being composed.⁷' ⁴⁶ No doubt the ear, even against its
will, patiently bears with such an accent, without which not a single scene could ever
be composed for the stage; nay, the sanie necessity had its influence upon the Greeks,
and met with the sanie indulgence.'’

A very obvious question to put to the propounders of such theories is, the number
of accents to be assigned to each word in the ordinary speech 01 the ancient Latins‘?
One, two or three? How, for instance, did they pronounce a proper name such as
Archidemidem in ordinary conversation? for in verse 254 it is employed twice, and each
time with three accents; ‘reculam-acmes in verse 267 has also three. Was this the correct
pronunciation (with three accents) 01 this proper name and 01 this word in the ordinary
conversation 01 the ancients‘? Again‚ the proper name Mnesilochus in verses 203, 243
is accented 011 both the first syllable and the last, and the same name in verses 215,
259, and 314 has only one accent, on second syllable. That is to say, if Mr. Lindsay
himself had been living ainongst the ancient Latins he would have had, according to
the theory, the gratification 01 hearing his own name pronounced two 01· three different
ways in the course 01 a day.

Those who devise such theories for the purpose of bringing the verses of Plautus
in the matter 01 Prosody into line with the poetry of the Augustan period are, in our
opinion, engaged in a useless, not to say senseless, pursuit (amnem-mn telas terentes).

In the same paper we find, “that proinde is used by Plautus before vowels, proin before
consonants, with perhaps not a single exception.'' Proinde is found before a consonant in
Ter. Heaut 65 ; Pers. iv. 4, 21 ; and Amph. 966; and no doubt other instances 01 the same
kind might be discovered; the latter before a vowel in Naevius, proin operte, and Proin
istae, Attius. We do not believe that the poet shows a preference for the one form more
than the other, except in so far as the exigencies 01 the nietre required, any more than other
poets. See Lueret. ii. 755; iii. 10903 iv. 499, 656, 1000; v. 570, 729, 10413 vi. 601, 620.

In the same paper on Latin Accentuation mentioned above, the writer says,
“It would be absurd to take the fact that the nietrical ictus falls on a certain syllable
of a particular word in a particular line 01 Plautus as a proof that the natural accent
fell on the same syllable in the ordinary pronunciation of the word in Plautus’ time-—
as absurd, in fact, as to suppose that metrical ictus and natural accent always coincide
in English lines, 01 rather a good deal more absurd, seeing that English inetre depends
