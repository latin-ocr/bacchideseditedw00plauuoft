Fleck.; the two last, however, adopt here “aequom uideo id reddere,’' the emend. of
Bothe. Muretus proposed ‘⁴ Sed aequum id ei reddere.” Uss. thinks the passage genuine,
but rejects entirely Sed eccum uideo incedere, thinking these words belong to v. 400. The
emendations are entirely conjectural, and in my opinion give no sense; “Him who
patched up the different parts,'' Goetz. The emend. of the old reading given here.
whoever wrote it, seems to be the only one from which any sense can be extracted. W.
and Goetz have Sed eccum uideo incedere. I have written esso me for eccum, believing, as
Ι do, that the latter has been the great stumbling-block to a rational explanation of the
passage. me uide02uide0r: cp. Men. iii. 1, 14. The young man says that nothing
except the gods surpasses a real friend (Pisa), and that he has learned this from ex·
perience; 110 then proceeds to give an instance, when he has occasion to mention
Chrysalus, who had reported to him the discovery of his mistress, and the trick he had
played on his father about the gold. He is quite delighted; and with the prospect of
obtaining the gold and the sister, thinks he is on the high road to prosperity, but
imagines himself, in his exultation, to be forgetting the claims of others to his con-
sideration, and especially those of the slave, who is proceeding so coolly and successfully
with his schemes on behalf of himself. Trans„ “But 1, Ι seem, to myself to be too

siust; “more extravagant.'' This is the reading of the MSS„ and of all the editors
except Uss., who writes infensius in the sense of molestius. Salmasius proposed strato
homine. The emend. of the former does not, however, in my opinion, accord with the
sentiments in this and the three vv. following. The young man is ringing the changes
on moral rectitude and ingratitude. Nothing is more hazardous to reputation than the
latter, for the pardon of a culprit is condoned as an act of mercy, while the abandonment
of a benefactor incurs the charge of ingratitude; therefore both good and bad alike
will commend the former, but even the bad themselves will find fault with the
latter. He is willing to wink at wrong-doing, provided he is not thought ungrateful,
but he must be careful and on the watch. This principle, with a view to his approval
of the proceedings of Chrysalus, he endeavours to reconcile to himself down to the end
of the scene.
