the word that precedes it. From the fact that it is generally employed with verbs in
the first person, Bentley thought that the e was an abbreviation of eya, but in several
cases φο occurs as well, and thereby to a certain extent invalidates his theory. Hc
says in his remarks on equidem, Ter., Heaut. iv. 1, 19; Ad. v. 3, 65, that it was always
constructed with a verb of the first person before the time of Nero. Ritschl in the main
adopts his view; see Prol., Trin., p. lxxvii. Priscian, the grammarian, says: “It ought
to be known that some think the conjunction equidem was compounded of ⁴⁰90 and
quidem, but they are 111istaken,'’ and “equidem can be referred both to the first and
second, and to the third person.'’ Most other critics and scholars, including Hand,
Freund, Ribbeck, XVagner (v. Trin.), Ussing, and Tyrrell, agree with the last. The e
is evidently an abbreviation of en orem in Latin, from which we also get eece, the Greek
ἦν, a particle of exclama-tion employed in calling attention. In vv. 434, we have

passages that there are no instances of a first pers. pl., or a second pers. sing. or pl., and
that the only persona] pronoun used is esso, also that there is a decided preference for a verb
in first pers. sing., with or without the pronoun. Passages might be quoted from later
poets and prose writers in which equidem is joined with verbs in first pers. pl., and second
sing. and pl., but the use of any persona] pronoun except εγω is rare. Hence it appears
that originally the particle was joined with the pers. pronoun of the first pers„ which,
following the general tendency of the classical languages, was very often omitted, and
that its application to other persons and numbers was gradually extended. What is stated
in the first part of last sentence might be illustrated from the writings of Sallust, and
particularly from Cicero. do hanc operam 3 hanc ; see n. v. 54. do operam ; see

and more emphatic distinction between this and the second; sor if utrum were omitted
