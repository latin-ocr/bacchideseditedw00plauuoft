COMMENTARY ΛΝΒ ΝΟΤΙΞΞ.

1. This and two following verses are spoken by Bacchis to the servants 01 the
house. Conver'r’ite ; the meaning 01 the simple verb verrere seems to be ‘⁵ to sweep ”;
then a secondary meaning is “to sweep away,” “to drag away'’; in figurative sense
it is used by Cicero, “futurum et omnia verreret Verres ’' (Cic, Fragm. apud Quint),
strengthened by the alliteration; cp. “domi quicquid habet, verritur ἔζω” (Truc. ii.
7, 8; also “caerula verrunt'' (Virg., Aen. iii. 2OS); and Lucret. vi. 624, “verrentes
aequora venti. Everrite aedes, abstergete araneas” (Titinius); and “Verrite aedes!
spargite munde! '’

The compound converrere means “to sweep up or out‚'’ as here; cp. Stich. 351,
374, 389; Merc. 11. 3, 62; Rud. iii. 6, 7; averrat in Truc.‚ Prol. 19, and erem-erit in 21.
This verb is from the same root, ¹vers or rer, as ἀπούρας, ἁπαυρςέω. R. supplies the object,
aedis, from conjecture, and to complete the verse.

scopis; “twigS,'' branches‚ a broom, root scalt .· cp. scopus, scopio. scapus, scipio,
σκῆπτρον; cp. Stich. 347, 351, 374.

2. “Munditias facite, spargite. Ecquis euocat '⁷ (R). We have “Munditias 11010
fieri” (Stich. 347); “munditiisque apparandis '⁷ (Stich. 673); 311(1 “consperge ante aedis''
(Stich. 354) ; cp. also Cas. ii. 3, 9. Ecquis, enquix, with n assimilated, a more emphatic
form 01 the interrogative; “is there any one to call⁷’‘? “will some one call''‘? see vv.
159, 232, 582-4, 1030; Pseud. 370, 333, 739, 740, 746, 743, 1138; Amph. 573, 349,
1013; Capt. 511, 83ος As. 429; Τ1·111. 37Ο; Stich. 222, 338, 342; Miles 7323 Curc.

3. nassiterna (nasus ternus), sometimes written with one 8 : a water-pail with three
spouts; “a sort 01 open water-vessel with a handle'' (Festus and Paulus), “uas
aquarium” (Plac., p. 69):urna, urceus (Fulgentius, p. 17) ; cp. Stich. 352. Ecthlipsis
is here disregarded, but this is allowable‚ as the ictus 01 the foot falls on cum.
impurissimum ; cp. Men. v. 2, 100. The next four verses are addressed by Bacchis
to an old man, probably an old leno attached to the house. Uss. calls him Demea,
a character in the Δὶς ἐξαπατῶν 01 Menander. R.. thinks they are addressed to ‘the
sister. Ι have followed Ussing’s arrangement. With this whole passage cp. Stich.

5. A hiatus must be admitted either after qui or viginti.

6. “ But this youth 131 surpasses Ulysses, wh0,’' (bc. Verum ; a strong adversative
particle, emphasizes the clause in which it stands, as contrasted with what precedes3
less emphatic than vere, which is rather an adverb. used 111 nearly the same sense, but
more so than at: cp. vv. 313, 317, 319-20, 593; Capt. 75, 602, 994; Cure. 375, 593.
adulescens, a young man, a youth, in a sort of depreciatory sense. Bacchis is evidently
mistaken as to the motives which bring Pistoclerus wandering about her dwellmg.
