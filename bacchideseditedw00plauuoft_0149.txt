COMMENTARY AND NOTEs. 89

likely, the necessity for a long syllable or the principles of phonology were not overlooked
in the use of ab before a consonant. Plautus has in fact elsewhere written, “Urna a se
cantat.” Se refers, of course, to the soldier3 see note v. 17. Nec; see note v. 473.
quiquam ; old form of atzam-ezqzcoqzzccnz .· cp. Cist. 87. There can be no doubt that the
abl. in 0 was fully established when this play was written, but there were some old forms
still lingering which our poet often avails himself of to relieve the monotony of his verse,
and avoid the frequent repetition of the same sounds in successive verses; a and al,
above may admit of the same explanation; see As. 228, 747; Pers. iv. 3, 8. Cum
quiquam limares caputzcum. quiqam osculareris ,· cp. Mero. iii. 1403 Poen. i. 2,
82, 84; also in a fragment of the Tereus of Livius Andronicus, and in the Leucadia
of S. Turpilius3 also in Caecilius.

32. Sic ut. Sic comprises the antecedent clause in itself‚ whilst nt, its correlative,
introduces the comparison in the relative clause. The antecedent clause might be
expressed, but by bringing the two particles together it is not required. Pistoclerus
has got a view of the sisters together, and in effect sayS, “ Just as milk is like milk, the
sister is like Bacchis.’' lacte (Plautine):lac: see v. 11:323 Amph. 595; Miles 240;
Men. v. 9, 29, 30. Ussing disposes satisfactorily, I think, of R.'s statement, that the
Comic poets never use similis with a dative; he quotes Capt. 576; Truc. ii. (3, 24;
Ter„ Eun. iii. 2, 15; and a fragment of Attius, “Silvani melo consimilem cantum”
(Argonautae). With regard to Zac, some editors state that it is never used in Plautus,
but if the text is correct, it occurs in Amph. 595, cited above; see also Men. v. 9, 30.
This line is the last of the fragments; part of the first scene of the play has been lost;
so that the next line may be taken, so far as the MSS. are concerned, as the beginning
of the first scene. It was a general opinion among the old editors of Plautus, that a
portion of this Comedy had been lost. They apply to it frequently the term ‘¹ Dimidiata
Fabula.” It was generally supposed to be the first part that was wanting. Hence in
1514 appeared the edition of N icolas Angelius, with an Argument, Prologus, and twenty-
seven lines of a first scene to supply the place of the missing part. Nobody ever
believed that these had been written by Plautus, yet they were repeated in the edition of
Canonicus, 1518, of Longolius, 1530, 1538, of Hervagius, 1535 and 1550, and in those
of Gryphius, 1535, 1537, 15403 Pareus also printed them. Ritschl traces this spurious
scene to Antonius Beccadellus or Panormita, a learned Sicilian, head of the Academy
at Naples. Rost seems to believe with others that there were two Recensions of the
Comedies, the second made either by Plautus himself or by some one since his time, one
or other of which has been now lost, to which the fragments cited by the grammarians
and inserted in the text belong. Rost thinks that the Comedy is complete, except
that there is no Argument or Prologue, and denies that portions of the fragments are
lost lines of the Bacchides at all, as wc have it. The three first lines of this Comedy
and vv. 347-55 of Stichus are much alike. For more information under this head the
student is referred to Dis. vii. De Plauti Bacchidibus, Ritschl’s Parerga, vol. i. As
that scholar's views on this subject seem the most plausible they have been adopted.

33. The MSS. have confounded the characters in this scene. B has E, the
sister, but Bacchis, to whom the line must be given, is preparing to make her attack on
the young man, Pistoclerus, and requests of the sister that she may do so, and asks her
assistance. hoc; antecedent to ut. potis estzpotest; cp. Miles 702; Trin. 759;
