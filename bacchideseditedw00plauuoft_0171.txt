OOMMENTARY AND NOTES. 111

see n. v. 144. hem ; Weise has generally leem throughout. Wagn., Uss., and Tyrrell‚
on the authority of Charisius and Ribbeck, recognise two particles, leem and em, with
meanings different. R. and F leck. appear to do so too, but always write cn for em. All
three forms are found in the older MSS. Editors, however, are not agreed about their
meaning; one tells us that ems should be used with imperatives, and constantly betokens
the infliction of a blow, While another assigns the same offic-e to hem. Hem, em, and en
were in Plautus demonstrative particles. There is no doubt about the reading here, but
Bothe, followed by Weise and Uss, has transferred the word to Chrysalus. P.. and Fleck.
have en: Goetz em. The meaning is “look here‚’' “ 300”; cp. Aul. 804; As. 428, 442,
871; Gapt. 625, 1001; Gurc. 121, 129, 195, 624; Most. i. 4, 20; iii. 2, 97, 118; iv.
3, 17; iv. 4, 8; Τ1111. 1069. In As. 428, Cure. 195, 624, it indicates the infliction of
a blow. In the seven plays referred to here, including the Bacchides, Ι have found
twenty-three instances of em, in one of which a blow appears to be indicated. In Most.
9 we have en where a blow has been given, but this particle is very rare in Plautus.
In sixteen of the plays, excluding the Poen., Pers„ Rud„ and Truc.‚ Ι have found
thirty-two instances of em or hem with a demonstrative or emphatic word following,
thirteen in questions, twelve with dat. sometimes accompanied by an accus„ eight
indicating a blow‚ four with an imper., three with accus, three where it is used
absolutely, and one with vocat. Ι believe Plautus used both as demonstratives, and
that they bear the same relation to each other as is and hic, of which they are old accuss.
Even in the MS. Β leem is the more frequent3 and this is to be expected, for hie is more
of a demons. than 125, nor can 1 find any instances of its use as a mere exclamation of
joy or sorrow; hence it appears to me equally reasonable to make lile, lzez'i, 1113, 01 hiis,
heeis conform to ii, eei, iix, eis, cais, as to refuse to admit 111111 of the older MSS. Of the
sixteen instances of hem, the reading of B, given above, there are five with a question,
four with demons. or emphatic word following, three indicating the infliction of a blow,
three with dat.‚ one with imper.

208. R„ Fleck„ and Uss.‚ following Bothe, Herm.‚ and Bent., read melior here
and omit bachis of the MSS.; but the phrase tanto melior, in the few instances in which it
occurs in Plautus, always refers to the person addressed, and must be taken in second
perS„ as in Truc. v. 61 ; 300 0130 Men. ii. 3, 84. It can have no reference to Pist., and
if admitted at all is an apostrophe addressed to the sister, hence “ Bacchis’' ought to be
retained, but this the exigencies of the metre will scarcely allow. Weise retains
“ Bacchis,⁷' but omits the second hercle. Though the v. might be scanned with
“Bacchis‚” in deference to the authorities Ι do not insert it. The reading of the text is
that of the MSS„ except the omission of Bacchis, and the sense is fully in accord with
the language of Chrysalus throughout the whole scene3 Chrysalus knows nothing of
“the Samian,” and takes no notice of this epithet when used by the young man, except
for the purpose of ridicule, but always calls the sister Bacchis. He has a suspicion
that Pist. himself is in love with her, as is shown by his language when he first met
him, and by his questions and remarks on the replies he received; and this suspicion is
