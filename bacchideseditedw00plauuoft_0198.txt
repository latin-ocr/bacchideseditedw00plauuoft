138 PLAI'TI BACCHIDES.

Many objections might be made against this v.; first, the position of Pist. and quod,-
second, ‹vt-nm, applied to the young man, who is always spoken of as the sodalis, silius,
discipulus: third, the use of tam and the meaning given to ciet. The two last objections
might be obviated by reading qur» perditum for quod erum tam. Without, however, being
satisfied with the reading in the text, Ι am unwilling to make the change; cp. As. 472.

‘ In reference to the conditional proposition in preced. v., it is worth while to note that neither
Latin nor Greek had a conditional meod, nor are writers on English grammar willing to recognise one
in English, though French, German, Italian, and Spanish have it. French and Spanish have special
forms for it. In German the subj. of an auxiliary verb, followed by an infinitivo, is used. And in Italian
the imperfect subj. is called the conditional. There can be no doubt that we have the forms for it in our
language, and that these forms have the meaning of such a mood; but as English grammar has
borrowed all its etymological apparatus from Latin, all such forms bare been relegated to the subjunc-
tive. This is to be regretted. For instance, “should pay‚’' “would pay,” “should have paid‚’‘ “would
have paid,'’ expressing the result of a condition in conditional propositione, are not subjunctives either
111 form or meaning, nor are they the representatives of the subj. of a verb of the same meaning in
Greek, French, or German, none of which employs the subj. at all in the apodosis in such propositione,
except that the last two sometimes use it, but not with the same meaning or in the same con-

nection as thc conditional. Greek used ἄν with optative, or indicative in connection with past tenses,
while the two languages mentioned had a conditional mood which expressed the required meaning.
Latin never produced a form capable of this, nor devised an adequate substitute, both meanings being
