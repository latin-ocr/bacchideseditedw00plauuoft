COMMENTARY AND NoTEs. ’“ 175

804. Em ; see n. v. 206. Aha; only found in Plautus.

805. ΒΘΙΙΘΡορΙηοηῒθΥης 566 Ηο61., Ilias vi. 155-211; Cic„ Tusc. iii. 26; Hor„
Od. i. 27, 18, &c.; iii. 7, 15, 12, 8; iv. 11, 283 Juv. x. 325; Milton, Par. L. vii. 17.

806. tetuli3 see n. v. 479. Sine; “minantis verbum, 561106 gut‚'’ W.; “formula
minandi‚'’ Acid.; Εἶεν, Uss.; “vim habet comminantis,'' Donat.; cp. Truc. ii. 8, 6;
Ter„ Hec. iv. 4, 85, and see n. v. 21.

807. Ρνορῒθνθεη followed by ut, as in v. 725.

808. pergraecetum cp. Most. 21, 613 iv. 3, 213 Poen. iii. 2, 26; Truc. 69;
much the same as congyraecem ‚· see n. v. 739. teruenefice, ter-veneficus; you triple
ruffian ; only found here, but cp. Aul. 86.

809. uenire sc. for pass. of aenda-63 see vv. 971-2.

810. lapide ; the stone on which slaves stood when being sold, sc. catasta, πρατῆρος
λίθος, πωλητήριον, «πρατήριον of the Greeks3 see Cio„ Pis. xv. 35 ; the preceding words,
eo ipso, have been emended, sc. eopse, unnecessarily, I think, by R„ and adopted by
Fleck„ Goetz and Uss. The last says that the words in the text are without sense;
“on that very stone,'' or “on 1116 very stone,'’ on which the praeco stood himself, which
was a public place, and therefore well known. ut; ubi is found in some old editions
(FZ, Becker), also in Weise, as a relative adverb for quo, answering 10 in eo ipso;
neither this reading nor that of R. just given 15 required to make better sense, for they
do not. ut praeco praedicat 56. te aemi-a “as the auctioneer 15 calling out that
you are on sale”; 566 Cic„ Off. iii. 13, 55.

811. Quem di diligunt, Adulescens moritum the Latin for ὅν οἱ Θεοῖ φιλοῦσιν,
ἀποθνήσκει νέος, 6 11116 of Menander, supposed 10 be from the Δὶς ἐξαπατῶν. Is eadit ante
diem qui sapit ante aiem.

812. Adulescens; “when young‘’; adverbial attribute, 65 11 15 called by some
grammarians; see Madv„ G. L. 220, and n. v. 6. dum ualet, sentit, sapit; cp.
Merc. ii. 2, 24; Poen. v. 4, 44 ; “while he 15 16 1115 11661111, 1115 566565, and J'udgment'';
the two last with almost the same meaning; see Cic„ Rep. i. 42, 65 ; and cp. vv. 998-9,

813. si uuus deus; stronger than 5ιῖ quis or qui deus. amaneu for the difference
in meaning between this word and diliyunt above cp. Cic„ Att. xiv. 17 ; Lael. xxvii. 100.

814. Plus; without affecting the construction, as in v. 459. iam; to be taken
closely with mortuom esse. mortuorm adj.; see n. v. 517. esse opovtuit, 15
a much stronger statement than if he had said fuisset ,· for forms like this in apodosis see
Madv„ G. L. 348 e obs. 1 ; owing to a defect in the verb “ ought,'’ which has neither 6 form
for the past nor a perfect participle, the translation is difficult, and the meaning of the
Latin often obscured; to take the words herc, we usually translate esse oportuit, esse
oportebat, “he ought to have been,’' translating esse, which is present, by a past tense
