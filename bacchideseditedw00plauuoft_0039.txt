METRES AND PROSODY. xxxiii

both in lengthening syllables on which it was placed, and in shortening those which it
either followed or preceded.”

He can give us only two nouns, Ἀχιλεὺς and Ὀδυσεὺς, 1)0111 proper names, in which
he says the accent shortens the preceding syllable; but these syllables are not long,
therefore they do not require to be shortened‚ they are both short by nature. The
lengthening and shortening of vowels in other cases in Homer and Virgil—we mean
the cases in which the shortening of a vowel long by position is not involved—can all
be satisfactorily explained without the accent, viz„ in Arsis and Thesis. In Virgil the
Arsis is scarcely ever under the word accent, and vowels are shortened by that poet,
and in Homer in hiatus.

Let us examine first the

senar-ius, or· lambio Trimeter‘ Acatalectic. The admissible feet in this
Metre in Comedy are the Iambus in all places; the Spondee, Dactyl, Anapaest and
Tribrach in all except the last. Dactyls and Anapaests are, however, employed more
sparingly than Spondees.

(V. 112.) “Cum tanta pompa? Pist. Huc. Lyd. Quid, huc? quis 16110 habet'“?
The rule here applies if we scan istic as a dissyllable‚ which is to be preferred.

(V. 113.) “Amor, Uoluptas, Uenus, Uenustas, Gaudium.” The rule holds good
again if it is here necessary, for the first letter of Ummscas is only a semivowel, and
there is interpunction.

(V. 114.) “locris, Ludus, Sermo. Suauisuauiatiost The last syllable of Iocus is
again short according to the rule.

(V. 140.) “Praesentibus illis paedagogus una ut sit.'’ Here the rule is at fault,
for 111 16 short without a short syllable preceding.

(V. 151.) “Nihil 1110101· discipulos nn'hi esse iam plenos sanguinis.’' The rule
can apply in both cases, maror, and csse taken as one short syllable.

(V. 185.) “Salutem tibi ab sodali solidam ni'intio.'’ Some editors would here,
perhaps, entirely elide tibi, but it seems better to take ab short with the rule.

(V. 186). “Rogabis me, ubi sit. Uiuit. Pist. Nempe recte ualet‘.>'' Some editors
scan here Nempe as a monosyllable; we believe it is better to follow the rule, and
shorten the first syllable of reete.

(V. 189.) “ Quia, si illa inuentast quam ille amat, uiuit, recte et ualet”; ῑίἷα 00111-
plies with the rule, but me is not amenable, seeing that it is not preceded by a short vowel.

(V. 190.) ιε81110111111161111161, minus ualet moribi'mdusque est'⁷; »tinais complies,
but there is no short syllable preceding mgribmzdeisque.

(V. 202.) “Ut istuc est lepidum! proxumae uiciniae’'; istnc is again amenable
to the rule.

(V. 210.) “ Non erus, sed actor mihi cor odio sauciat.'’ Some editors write res
here, but it is better to follow the rule and write eras.

(V. 215.) “ Edepcl, Mnesiloche, 111 hanc rem natam esse intellego‘’; esse does not
comply with the rule, 1ῑηευῖἰιῃο does, if the former is admitted.

(V. 217.) “Nam istoc fortasse aurumst epus. Pist. Philippeo quidem.'' This
v. might be scanned by Philpreo‚ but perhaps it is better to make istoc a monosyllable
and write opas* according to the rule.

(V. 223.) “Dum quidem hoc ualebit pectus perfidia meum''; Ιιοσ short, in com-
pliance with the rule.
