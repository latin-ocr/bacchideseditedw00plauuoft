COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 201

Η91·0 there is a diaeresis; cp. Poen. iii. 5, 13 iii. 6, 19; Rud. iii. 5, 29; iv. 4, 85, 109;
Miles 363; Capt. 353.

1056. ut soluam militem ; the MSS. have been followed here; militi, of Lamb.,
Bothe, W.‚ R. and Uss.‚ does not solve the difficulty, and if absoluam of Scaliger, Fleck.
and Goetz is intended to be used in any sense whatever with a direct personal object,
their emend. is useless, for absoluam militem does not mean “that Ι may pay the
soldier,'’ neither have the words in the text that meaning; the verb and its com-
pounds cannot be used in the sense of “to pay‚'’ unless with the object of the thing
expressed. The sense here will be found to be nearer that of soluere in ers-oluere (vv.
852-3, 856-7, 957, and in Hor.,Epod. xvii. 7; Epist. i. 16, 78) than of ‹wa-soluere
(v. 1133), where object of thing is implied. The meaning is exactly the same as in “ut
hunc absoluam,’' Ter., Ad. ii. 4, 13; cp. also Capt. 7253 Mero. i. 2, 57; see Epid. v.
1, 25 ; Most. iii. 2, 155, and cp. Curc. 454 ; Aul. 512. When a verb is used with a special
meaning, and an object of the thing· is included in that meaning, as would be the case
here were the emend. adopted, we cannot force the sense out of it without the object.
If the object of the thing were expressed, “ut soluain militi,’' “that Ι may pay the
money to the soldier,'' would be adinissible, but without that it does not appear to 1119 to
admit of translation. The old inan does not say that he will go to theforum to pay the
soldier—this may be gathered from the context——but that he will go to the forum “to
discharge’' or “get rid of the soldier.’' If a pronoun or any noun just previously
mentioned could be supplied, Lamb.'s emend. would be admissible, but this cannot be
done. In Ter„ Ad. ii. 1, 10, iv. 4, 20, Phorm. v. 2, 15, simple verb means “to pay.”
In And. ii. 1, 33, iv. 1, 19, v. 4, 52, it means to “release''

1057. equidem; see n. v. 72. proin tu quaeras qui fevat3 “therefore do
you get someone to take it.'’ pr‘oiru see n. v. 735.

1058. ewedh “trust,” or “entrust’⁷ anything· to anyonc; cp. vv. 272, 280, 282,
315, 694, 746, 917, 1155. Cape uer'03 “do take it, pray ''; some of the old editions
have Cane here. uer‘o; see n. v. 6, and Madv.‚ G. L. 437 (1; also Cas. iii. 6, 12.
odiose faci& “your conduct is vexatious”; cp. v. 1061 ; Cic„ Brut. lxxxii. 284.

1059. equidem; see n. v. 72. Αῒ; “well but’'; see n. v. 6, and Madv„ Gr. L.
437 c. quaeso ; ut clause interrupted by next speaker or te to be supplied ; ‘⁶ Ι beseech
you.'' Dico, ut Pes se habet; ‘⁶ 1 am telling yon, as is the fact ’³ ; cp. Caes„ Bell.
Gall. ii. 19; 010, Fam xi. 12; Ter., Eun. iv. 7, 30.

1060. ΜοΡεῑΡθ; “you are detaining me⁷'; cp. v. 337; 010, Fam. vi. 20; Juv. i.
125; and Miles 946, 1310; Merc. ii. 3, 130; v. 2, 89; Cas. iii. 5, 97. concredh
cp. Aul. 6073 Cas. ii. 8, 43 ; Pers. iii. 3, 37; Hor., Sat. ii. 6, 433 Cic., Quint. xx. “Vel
quibus obsessos possit concredere muros,” Virg, Aen. x. 286.

1061. Uen well, at least; see n. v. 827. qui me sevuet3 “to watch 1119,” as
obseruare, v. 284; cp. Aul. 356, 547, 549; As. 7983 Men. i. 3, 33; Rud. iv. 1, 43 Ter.,
And. i. 3, 7; Heaut. iii. 3, 31. Ohe; omitted by Guyet, Bothe, R.. and Fleck. ; Goetz
and Uss. with Corssen and others transpose sc. seruet me ‚· W. as in the text. Some of
the old editors have omitted all this v. up to and including seruet. Some critics also
(those who transpose or omit readings of the MSS„ Uss., Guyet, Miiller, R„ Fleck.
and Goetz) refuse to admit a proceleusmaticus into the Iambic verses of Plautus.
There is room for such a foot, and as there is authority for its admission Ι think it
may stand here; for the word under review cp. Aul. 55; Cas. ii. 3, 34; Hor., Sat.
i. 5, 12; ii. 5, 96; Pers, Sat. i. 23; Mart. iv. 89, 1, 9; quantity, both vowels may be
