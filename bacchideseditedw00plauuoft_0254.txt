194 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

Pocn. iii. 4, 21-33, v. 2, 131, 133, where Quippim' is repeated 6 1111195 111 mockery by
the 5111119 speakcr; Men. iv. 2, (33-7; see also n. 1·1’. 138, 518. 111 Rud. iii. 1-ss 111111 Merc.
ii. 1-3 the 111195 arc the same. If this argument has any weight‚ and I do not believe it
ought, why not omit “Quid . . opus est”‘.> of the slave, which occurs in this 1·., 91111
again in 986 91111 989, 111111 used 111 1119 last even after he has told the old man (v. 987)
that 119 will be present; the words, however, may be taken as referring to Animum
achon-tito (preccd. v.). The old man also uses ades twice (v. 983 and 986) 111 exactly
the same sense. But the meaning of the group of words proposed to be excluded
is 1101 the 5111119 111 1119 three vv„ here there 15 9 request, while in 987, after the
slave continues to persist in his refusal and the old man has ordered him in the v.
preced. to be silent, it 15 a command with the addition of id, and in 989 1119 command
is strengthened by the use of At enim and te after further persistence on the part of the
slave. Let it be noted also that the old man meets 1119 refusal of the slave by the
repetition of the same words or the same words strengthened; in 989 1119 latter says,
after a long argument of six vv. between the two, “Nolo‚ inquam,” and the reply to
this 15, “At 11010, inquam.” Also, (ἰ scias, [rc. (next v.)‚ comes in better after the
words 10 bc omitted than after L'olo alone of Uss.

except Uss.‚ who has Jt'n, from GD, required by the metre, according to the (115-
11·11)1111011 of the words in his text. eu, found in some of the MSS. of Plautus, is not
50 strong as engle, and there is no necessity either in sense or metre sor its admission
here. Uss., in his note on this v.‚ denies that the word in the text can be used to
express wonder, a meaning that 119 ascribes to (ηις but in two at least of the references,
59. Epid. 7 and And. ii. 2, 8 below, it has clearly this meaning, while in one certainly
of the references, sc. Most. 1. 4, 26, given by him in reference to eu, the notion of wonder
does not seem to be admissible. The exact meaning of interjections, mere exclamations
which express no idea, but merely indicate feeling, is difficult and must be considered in
connexion with the context3 they can hardly be classified. It may not be out of place
to quote here a well-known writer on this point. He says, “An interjection implies a
meaning which it would require 9 whole grammatical sentence to expound, and it may
be regarded as the rudiment of such a sentence. But it is a confusion of thought to
rank it among the parts of speech. It is not in any sensc; it 15 a whole though an
indistinct expression of feeling or of thought. An interjection bears to its context the
same sort of relation as a pictorial illustration 11095.” “Some interjections have so
vague‚ so fihny a meaning that it would take a great many words to interpret what their
meaning is. They seem to be as well fitted to be the echo of one thought or feeling as
another, or even to be no more than a mere melodious continuation of the rhythm. It
15 of the very nature of an interjection that it eludes the meshes of a definition.” Cp.
