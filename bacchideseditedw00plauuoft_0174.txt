114 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

variety 01 construction with opus est and the twelve instances of the use of nom. given
above, together with the authority 01 1116 M δὲ, sully warrant, Ι think, the reading in the

iii. 4, 3; Trin. 152. Just as we can call a “penny,'’ a “shilling‚'⁷ a “florin,‘' a “crown‚”
a “ sovereign '’ a coin. so the Romans said nummus, though the coin indicated might be
brass, sih-er, or gold, 101 111 1110 111116 01 Plautus there was no Roman coin called nummus,
hence when this term occurs the particular one meant must be gathered from the
context. The nummus mentioned so often in Plautus could not be the nummus sestertius,
the name 01 0 00111, which was 01 silvei· ; 101 111 11101 0036 110 never could have written
Philippa· *nummzss which is frequently found, nor Philippeo (mommo) in the text, seeing
that they were 01 gold. The fact that sestertius, which is only an adj„ usurped the place
of namneus, goes to show that it was never the name of any particular coin. The
‹lenm-iux and tho Greek drachma were in circulation among the Romans in the time 01
Plautus. What is stated above is confirmed by Poen. i. 37, where we have “aurei
trecenti nummi Philippei.” 111 sing. and pl.,without an epithet, it can often be rendered
“coin'' or “money‚'’ and in Plautus it is generally applied to Greek pieces 01 money,
but not always. 111 1116 present passage a single coin, “a Philip,‘⁷ is meant—a sense
which would be impossible were the reading 01 FZ adopted, for the parasite, v. 591, and
the soldier, v. 877, demand two hundred, and 1 submit the words here 0011 have no other
meaning. The v. ought to be rendered, “ For perhaps this gold is needed ; '² or, “For
perhaps gold is required there.’' Pist., “For the Philippean coin, at all events, it is;’'
or, ‘⁴ Yes, the Philippean coin is requirod.’' Though Pist. has already been informed of the
demands 01 1116 soldier by Bacchis, he makes no mention 01 1116 amount required, but only
hints that as a Philip needs to be 01 gold, so this is the sort 01 00111 wanted. It ought to be
noted that 1'.s·tm·,s'‹n·ta.s·.s›e is answered by Philippeo quidem 3 cp. Cic„ Or. 62. With regard to
the 101110 01 0 Philip there appears to be no agreement amongst either lexicographers or
editors. It will be observed that umnmns is the general 161111 for a coin in Latin, and that
coined money was generally eomputed in ‹Irae-lunae at Athens. Therefore the coin men-
tioned here was 0 gold piece the weight 01 two drachmae, worth rather more than 153. 3d.
English currency in Greecc 01 1110 111110 1116 writers 01 1116 New Comedy flourished, and
in lingland at the present day, owing to the depreciation in the value 01 3111161 in com-
parison with gold, it would be equal in valne to a much larger sum—more than 203.
sinim, Matinum-ys qsAnzirJJszies, gives the value at 163. 311, and Wagner, in 0 11016 in
the Trinummus, says that it was worth 15s. 11 was the most valuable coin in circulation.

Pist., but getting no satisfactory reply proceeds, using the same construction with which
he had commenced. eo, refers to (co) z'7u·c)zt(), v. 216. fortasse3 see n. preced. v.

Uss. assign them to Chrysalus, sor no other reason apparently than that they object to the
repetition of mile-5¹, 101· 1νο have no proof that Plautus did not assign them to the former.
