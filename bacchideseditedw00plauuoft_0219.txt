607. ln eum numm the last rejected by all editors since Bothe, hence revenit,
for which Gertz and Uss. read “devenit‚’' must be taken as perfect. The retention of
nunc and revenit, taken in present, give much better sense than if the former were
omitted and the latter taken as perfect. The hesitation of the editors to accept the
readings of the MSS. here, as in the great majority of other places where emendation is
persisted in, arises from their scruples about the metre. The only thing to object to is
that ut is short, but it is never anything else, for a consonant following does not of
necessity lengthen it in Plautus. It is short without accent. The use of revenit
shows that Pist. believes that the affair is now coming back to the position in which it
was before he and Chrysalus took the business in hand; see Amph. 935.

616. Maleuolente ingenio; “malevolens'’ and its op. “benevolens” are very
generally nouns in Plautus, or being applied to persons “homo’‘ or “homines” can
be easily supplied. ingenio, here, has not the same meaning as in v. 12, where it
appears to have the meaning of shrewdness or cleverness; here it is natural quality or
disposition, whereas “animo’' in v. 613 may be rendered “disposition,’⁷ as a state of
the feelings subject to change; op. Trin. 3034 ; Mero. v. 4, 8, 9. ροεῒνθϊηο; 366 11. v.
