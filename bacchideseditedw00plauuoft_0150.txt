“ Ille quidem hoc cupiens potis est per tela virosque '² (Ἧι-3., Αο11. ix. 796); “mederi

352. ⁴· Nec devitari letum pote quin obeamus '’ (Lucr. iii. 1079); “Si quidquam dici
pote ” (Cat. ). Fotis is an old subst. or adj. used adverbially, and in this way is compounded
with sum, «10; in fact. potis sum, &c., is only an older form of possum, &c., and with the
same meaning; a strong argument in favour 01 115 adverbial character, seeing that
there is no objection to the use of adjectives in pl„ is the invariable practice of
the Latin writers in writing potis, even when the subject 01 1110 verb is pl.; for “divi
potes ’¹ of Varro may be an error 01 1110 MSS. With this word the verb substantive is
rarely written and must be supplied. Ροει1 is not neut. 01 potis, but a shortened form
01 same; cp. magle for mam's and sat for satia Case-endings appear to have been but
faintly pronounced by the Latius in the speech 01 every—day life, and consequently we
may expect to find occasionally forms in Plautus written as they were pronounced.
Pate. may bc also an abbreviation of potes, potest, or even posse, on the principle, as has
been stated above, that words in common use were often shortcned; potis may also have
been written for pates or potest, but all the passages cited above are in favour 01 1110 101111
111 the text. Dr. Wagner's note v. 80 (Trinummus), that this word is a neut. adj„ a
contracted form 01 potius and equal to it, is open to objection, for potius is found in
Plautus; see vv. 102, 209, 499, 723, 10363 and potis has not the meaning of a
comparative; it is an old word found almost exclusively in poetry with a comparative of
its own, and so it is reasonable to conclude that it is the older word; but quite the.
opposite 01 this would be the case were it a shortened form of potius. The explanation
given by Corssen to account for the termination is in adverbs may be accepted in the
case 01 massis, nimis, and in words having the meaning of a comparative, and without any
other comparative form in use, but is, 1 think, inadmissible 111 1110 case 01 potis, satis, the
former 01 which appears to be an old subs. whose stem is pot or poti ,· s is the case suffix.⁴
Fors is used as an adverb in a similar manner. Lepidm ‘⁴ with pleasure'’; cp. v. 81 ;
