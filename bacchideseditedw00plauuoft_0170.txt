110 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

proximae viciniae of BD, Lamb.,Bothe, Dousa, W.‚ and Goetz; the same phrase
occurs in Most. v. 1, 14, where all the MSS. read praruma. In Miles 273, Β only
has pros-nme, which Brix and Tyrrell reject for prat-imae, the reading of A and C; R.
would read praa-nme in both passages. Ι have no doubt that the correct reading here
is pros-zonae viciniae for proxume, as an adverb of place is seldom used by Pl. or Ter.,
and its construction in good Latin writers is generally with an accus, or proposition
and its ease. Besides, viciniae could not be taken as a part. gen., and would have to
be construed as a loc. case in a sort of apposition to pros-nme. The words in the text
have exactly the same meaning as in¹ proavumo, Miles 264, 301, 319, 366, except that
there is a little more emphasis. The idea is generally expressed by an adv. of place or
a preposition with a case of proxe'mzmz, or the preposition and prox. are omitted and
ric-[niae used with adv. as a part. gen. or loc. case. The adv.‚ adj.‚ and subst. together
are only found in Miles 273. The preposition is never used with ricinia, and never
omitted with proxumum 3 but as ricinia could be used without the prep., either with or
without the adj.‚ in the first an abl„ in the latter a loc., the adj. was made to conform
to the case of the subst., and both put in loc. This view is supported partly by grammar,
and what is more important in the language of Plautus by the usage of every-day speech,
on which its rules are founded. Grammar also shows that some substantives, or neut.
adjectives used as such, have not the same meaning with a preposition in abl. as with-
out it. And this is so in this case; ιή proxumo is not the equivalent of proxumo, and
much less is it its equivalent where defining a substantive. The preposition, therefore,
not being required, the sympathy of similar sounds, and all but identity in meaning of
the abl. and loc. cases, drew both words together, and out of two synonymous phrases
formed one which contained both. In Most. v. 1, 14, wc have in fact this phrase in
abl. without the preposition, where ricinia has yielded in case to pron-ima. In addition

The translation, “ She lives next door.''

203. Et quidnam ; there is no necessity here for In'cquidnam, the emendation of
Pius. The et is but faintly pronounced, and does not cause any harshness of sound;
besides. the meaning is sufliciently clear without the change. This is the reading of
all the MSS. The slave is interrupted in his enquiries about the sister, but on hearing
that she has been found, and lives so convenient, proceeds to question Pist. earnestly
about her feclings to his master. Cic. uses et in a question of this sort; sce Pro Man.
