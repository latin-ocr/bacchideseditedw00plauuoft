137. pam “suitable”; with much the same sense in Trin. 279. neque sit
consentaneum3 “nor can it be consistent.'’ He hesitates, trying to humour the
tutor, and therefore uses the subj., or it may be a sort of conditional clause with Quum,
as protasis; cp. Curc. 165; Cic„ Off. iii. 33, 117; Fin. ii. 22, 70.

138. This line has been variously emended by editors. Camerarius, following
Pylades, inserts herus before lez'c; Bothe has ipsus after hic, changing sit to siet,
Herm. . . . haeceintusa.s·sintet‹=rus . . . Weise follows Cam. and Bothe in reading herus
and siet. Ritschl and Fleck. read una before cnm, but the former also proposes another
reading with herus before sit, and writes amis-acl. This Muller follows, except that he
inserts ιιηα after amica. Uss. reads herus in conventu instead of hic intus. On going
over the text, from such a variety of emendations, Ι had adopted that of Bothe, but after
some thought on the passage was obliged to fall back on CD. The only change is Ieic
for haec of the MSS. Pist. is speaking of himself in third pers. Of this way of speaking
we have several instances in Plautus: in Mero. 1. 4, 36, the speaker speaks of himself
in third pers„ as ‘⁶ hunc senem”; in Trin. 172, “haec caneS,'’ with a verb in third pers„
refers to the speaker; and also in 1115 of same play Lysiteles commences with ‘⁴ Hic
homost‚’' δια, referring to himself. See also Soph, OEd. Tyr. 805 ; Antig. 1034 ; Stich.
231; Eur„ Alc. 690; and vv. 237, 240, 642, 684, 823, 849, 1139 of this play, and n. v. 54.
And to address oneself in second pers. is a form of speaking often met with; see Mero.
i. 2, 1-9; Trin. 1008-15; Cist. iv. 2, 25. Ηίο, 111 this v. refers to the speaker, and
is to be taken with first intus: homo may be supplied. The speaker is stirred with
great enthusiasm, and frequently indulges in alliteration and the habit of punning on
words of similar sound, as here in regard to the different applications of intus. When
addressing the tutor he points to his breast and says, “ When this man here within (my
very self) is within’' (the house), &a In Merc. i. 2, 78, we have [ntus intra naz-im.
Intus is used in this way by Plautus, v. 3763 ›Cist. iv. 2, 19; Nam «ἐ intus pareo et foris
farmido: Cure. 399 . . ol, rem publicam ha<- intus est milii, and “sed intus etiam in animis
inclusae inter se dissident '' (cupiditates), Cic.; Hor.‚ Ars Poet. 108; “Utrum foris
habeat exemplar, an intus,⁷⁷ Seu. ; “ego te intus et in cute novi‚'' Pers„ Sat. iii. 30. “et
intus . . Palleat infelix, quod proxima nesciat uxor''·? Pers„ Sat. iii. 42; so V. 129, “sed
si intus et in iecore aegro . . Nascuntur domini''; ct Ju'ttrl'as intus deprendere curas, Ovid,
Met. ii. 94. In Greek, ἐιτός and ’ἔιδον are used in thc same way, ἐντὸς {zv-rh γίγνεσθαι,
Hdt. i. 119; ἐντὸς &ptam-30, Hdt. vii. 47; ἔνδον, φρένας ἔνδον ἐίσας, Ηο111., Od. xi. 337; xiv·

xx. 16; ’ἔνδον γενδυ, Α93911., Choeph. 233. It will be observed that the first intus is used
in a sort e ’ figurative, the last in a literal sen se; also that the first is attributive, the other
predicatss 2 . For the use of an adv. of place as an attribute, see also Livy xxiv. 3 and passim.
