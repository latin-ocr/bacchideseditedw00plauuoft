17Ο PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

727. uevbis tui83 ⁴‘ in your own name ''; cp. Amph. 9603 Cas. ii. 3, 56; Miles
913; Γο011.1.2, lom v. 2, 40.

728. Quid δὴ sce 11. v. 77. morbum et mor-tem scribat sc. dicat: wish
disease and death to the old man, and so become possessor of all the gold without
further trouble; cp. v. 12063 Lucr. vi. 1095; Most. i. 3, 76 .· see Ter„ Phorm. ii. 1,
14. 1'ectiUS3 ep. 1·1·. 45, 117, 327, 731; Ter„ Ad. iv. 1, 5; 1·. 7, 22.

729. Ne interturba3 assigned by R„ Goetz, and Fleck. to Chrys.; “do not
create confusion,’' “do not interrupt'’; the last word is rarely found. ceren wax
spread over the smooth surface of the tabellae for the purpose of writing on, as in v. 992.
Dic quem ad modum3 cp. v. 471; Miles 904; Pers. 37.

730. Adscribe h003 ‘⁴ write this as well.''

731. usque quaque; continually everywhere; last word as adv. rare; cp. Miles
1134. loquitur; “is talking to me.’' nec recte3 and he is not right in talking
10 1110 011 the subject; see n. v. 117.

732. quia non, followed by subj„ change of mood due 10 negative, or oblique,
because I did not defi-aud you, as he says defraudauer’im ; cp. Ter„ Phorm. 10.

733. dum; “until‚'' with pres. indic.; cp. Ter„And. ii. 1, 293 Eun. i. 2, 126;
Heaut. iv. 3, 393 iv. 7, 5. It is not so unusual to find a past or fut. indic. after it in
this sense. In this place, however, dum might be rendered “whilst'' without any
perceptible injury 10 1110 sense.

734. At quidem, of Uss., Miiller, and Goetz, has been adopted; cp. v. 674;
Most. iv. 4, 22; W. follows the MSS„ Herm„ R„ and Fleck. have Haec quidem without
MS. authority. Atque idem is also found in an old reading of R. in; emended from em
or leem of the MSS. and an old reading of R. est ad, of Pylades, has been adopted by
Camer. and R„ who transposes est, and in one reading omits acl, and by Fleck„ Goetz,
and Uss.; W. has ad. My objections to the readings of above editors are that, without
in any case giving better sense, they omit portions of the best MSS. and admit words of
which no trace can be found there. These objections have been removed in the reading
in the text. If in perdendum be objected to from the fact that in with accus. of gerund
is never found, it can only be replied that it would be altogether unfair, while admitting
the correctness 01 Plautus' grammar, to apply too rigidly the rules for more elaborate
compositions 10 1110 simple, colloquial, and unlearned language of every-day life which our
poet is obliged to employ. Only two very slight emendd. have been made—that of
Miiller and Uss. at beginning of v. and in for em or leem of the MSS. Pist.⁷s reply may
be rendered, ‘⁴ Yes, but upon my faith it needs to be active rather for spending quickly
than writing quickly.’⁷ Peculiar constructions are found occasionally in old writers, as
for instance the gerund or gerundive followed by accus„ just as the verbal in Greek,
and, in fact, a verbal noun with accus. is sometimes met with; cp. Amph. 515; Truc.
ii. 7, 72, 73; As. 911; and see Trin. 869. The infinitive or gerund in Greek is often
put in accus. with article after εἰς in the same sense as in here; cp. Xen„ Cyr. i. 4, 5;
Demos. 50, 25 ; Gr. T. 1 Thess. ii. 16. The forms of gerund in uv have not been admitted,
as the MSS. are not clear on the point, and there is no doubt that Plautus often
employed those in e. cito, has been written instead 01 cita of Herm„ R„ Fleck„ and
Ifss„ and citus 01 Ζ and W.; cp. Liv. i. 8; also see Cas. ii. 3, 27; 11. 4, 16.

735. pvoim cp. Capt. 546, 849, 859; Pseud. 1197; Cas. 25; Rud. v. 2, 44; Ter„
