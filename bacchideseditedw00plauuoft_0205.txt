COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 145

27, 19. Lamb., Bothe, Camer., Herm., and MS. Β have aestuoso. absorbe& 011. v.
369. ubi quemque; uti for quamlocumqne; cp. Amph. 1064, 1079; Capt. 498, and
cp. Frag., Vidul. 1.

469. eam esse; MSS. and W. esse eam: Guyet, R„ Fleok„ Goetz, and Uss.
ΕΧ Samo; see n. v. 197.

470. Quae vocatur Ρ 011. Amph. 3783 sic or ita to be supplied as antecedent of
quemadmodum, next v.

471. atque; does not connectfalso and insontem„ but Pistoclerum and the latter; it
has therefore the same meaning asin 1110 passages cited v. 84, which see. angui& has
not the same meaning as in v. 466, but means “ you are accusing,” charging or censur-
ing, &c.; cp. v. 8033 Men. iv. 2, 93.

472. benevolenti ; invariably used by Plautus as 3 1101111, 11010 11 0311 110 taken as
such, “well-wisher'’; cp. v. 5543 Most. i. 3, 38; Pseud. 698-93 Trin. 46, 356, 1148;
Cas. ii. 7, 12.

473. Rem mandatam exsequitui²; rem mandatam ywere (nextv.) and res mandata.
αῃὶ (v. 476) have not the same meaning3 the second is the proper expression, “to
execute 3 001111111331011”; 1110 first contains the notion of completion, or of bringing it to
a successful issue; the last means nothing more than to be engaged in such 3 0011111113-
sion. neque amat; although [ss. gives amet as 1110 reading in A and B, neither he
nor any other editor adopts it. nec; Geppert asserts that oze is found in A; however
that may be, the sense would not be much improved by its admission. The usual form
in prohibitions of this sort is 111111),- but cp. v. 31; As. 7683 Hor., Od. ii. 11, 4; Ov„
Am. iii. 14, 21, &c.; Cio„ Verr. iii. 48, 1153 Off. i. 1343 Rep. i. 2, 3; Quint. iii. 2.

477. nisi ; emend. of Uss„ which 1133 110011 adopted in preference to transposition,
the method followed by all other editors except R„ who proposed aut before labra. It
is very probable that the slave may have emphasized his assertion by the repetition, and
that the word has been omitted by the copyists. a; Weise alone has ab, which he
says is found in the MSS.; Bothe and the rest the reading in the text. A copyist may
have been misled by an ab preceding and another following the preposition.

478. dispudet; cp. Most. v. ii. 443 Ter., Eun. v. 1, 16. dis, with force of valde,
according to Charisius.

479. tetulit ; the reading in C and A, adopted by all editors; old perfect of tollo;

Το1., And. iv. 5, 13; v. 1, 13.

480. pudere ; depen. on memorare v. 478 .· hist. infin. or gerund3 first explanation
to be preferred. quidquam3 nom.‚ if second explanation be adopted; cp. Mero. v. 2,
71; Cas. ii. 3, 28; Ter., Ad. i. 2, 4; iv. 7, 36; Phorm. v. 9, 33, and see Madv„ G. L.
218 3, 0113. 2. Quid verbis opust Ρ rightly retained by W. and Uss.,· and printed
but condemned by Goetz; expunged by R. and F leck., thereby leaving a blank in v.‚ who
think the words here have been borrowed from v. 483 and taken the place of the true
reading, which is supposed to have been lost. R. conjectures “factis prodidit,'' without,
however, putting the words in his text.

481. ροΡ111; 300 11. v. 278. huice; old form for huie, adopted by R. and Fleek.;
W.'s huiic is indefensible. Uss. and GoetZ, following Miiller, write sues after huic, for
which there is no authority.
