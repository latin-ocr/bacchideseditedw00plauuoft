COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 147

compared with the violence done the MSS. For the remainder of the v. R. substitutes
hic for si,· Fleck. has liic after illo, with si omitted; Goetz writes lwc for ilco, which he
says is found in A. illo refers to Mnes., for Lydus has taken no notice of factm volo,
and perhaps has not heard the words.

494. Ι have followed Uss. here3 Fleek. has the same, but he and R. have est after,
instead of before, curae, and the last reads Mnesiloche of A, which is adopted. All the
editors mentioned have rightly, as I think, given concastiga . . . . to end of next v.
to Lydus. W. and Goetz have followed the common reading found in the MSS„
inserting est after Adfatim, and assign concastiga, ἀρὴ, to Phil. The readings and
distribution of the words here followed have been adopted on the strength of what has
been collected from A, and on the authority of R, Fleck., and Uss. Concastiga;
cp. v. 11753 Trin. 1, 4. pvobe; thoroughly, “soundly'’; cp. vv. 696, 762, 775;
Amph. 314, 968, 990; Capt. 2Gs; Cas. 36; Most. 43 v. 1, 193 T1·in.s96; Poen. v. 4, 72.

495. Cp. this v. with vv. 374, 377 of same speaker. This, and what precedes, is
evidently addressed to the old inan, but he seems to take little notice of what is said, and
continues his address to Mnes. Camer.‚ Pareus, Bent.‚ Bothe, and Uss. read amicosque
W. omits the conjunction altogether. A, R„ and Fleck. have been followed, except
that these two editors have transposed me: Goetz as in the text. flagitiis suis; see
n. v. 165.

496. ln te (accus.) eg03 W. alone adopts etym of the other MSS.; other editors
have followed A.

497. inimiciorem ; found in A, and perhaps B, and adopted by Lamb., R„ Fleck.,
and Uss. Bothe followed the reading in B; Weise and Dousa have amiciorem of Z.
magis, to be taken with credam.

498. Sodalemne, for utrm, followed by oze . . . an: see n. v. 733 but here
utrum may be taken as an adj„ when reference does not apply; see Men. v. 9, 60.

499. potius, and magis, v. 497 ; both comparative& the former implies preference,
the latter degree; see vv. 102, 209.

500. ΝΘ sc. nai. illum referring to Illum exopt. hercl& see 11. v. 203. SU03 all
editors except Pylades and W„ who have meo of the other MSS, which have 3110, meo.

501. mihi divini nunquam quisquam creduat; a kind 01 proverb, according
to VVeise, the full expression of which he says would be “mihi nunquam quisquam
creduat neque divini quidquam, neque humani,'' of which the latter part, being included
in the former, has been omitted. Uss. explains as if Mnes. had said “juranti mihi
nemo eredat.” As regards grammar, dii-im· appears to be gen. depending on quidmmm,
to be supplied. This seems to agree with the explanations just given, but the editors
mentioned also favour the belief that credere is sometimes used with a gen., the only
other instance of which, if this be taken as one, assuming the reading to be correct, is
Truc. ii. 2, 52. num. quis. orveduau more emphatic in adjurations than if he had
said oze quis unquam meditat,- for last form see n. v. 473; and with whole passage cp.
Amph. 665 ; As. 845; Poen. ii. 20. It may be mentioned that Camer. read ‹liz-om nun.
quidquam, and that Lamb. and Dousa had also qzcc'dqzcam.

, 502. Νἰ; see n. v. 321. exemplis plurumi& cp. v.1088; Capt. 685; Most. i.
3, 35, 55; iv. 4, 46; Ter„ Phorm. iv. 4, 7; Eun. v. 4, 24. plane.; quite, “entirely'';
cp. As. 650; Truc. iv. 1, 9; Pseud. 1213; Pers. v. 2, 66. am03 said in irony, as is
clear from the two vv. which precede and that which follows. The use of the word is
