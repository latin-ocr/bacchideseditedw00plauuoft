448. Pylades, Herm.. R., Fleek„ and Goetz assign this v. to Lydus, contrary to the
best MSS.; W. and Uss. as in the text.

449. The same editors. including Uss., give this v. to Lydus, contrary to the MS.
B (according to Uss, and F Z according to Goetz), which W. alone has followed. The
sense is not clear, hence they are obliged to adopt the emend. of Herm.,wh0 inserts
haud before mavellem without any MS. authority. While agreeing with W. and the
MS„ I think he is mistaken in supposing that inum refers to Lydus, for Mnesilochus
has not yet taken any notice of the other speaker, and it is to the words of Lydus, as
the previous speaker, that he always refers, whom he speaks of as hie, huius. It is the
question of Philoxenus, who is the first to see him, that calls forth this v. from
Mnesilochus, who repeats the verb ridere of the question, and uses the same construction;
deos propitios and illum are subjects of videre, not object-s. If Mnes. had been
speaking os Lydus here he would have said hunc. Sed quis liic ext in preceding v.
shows by hic that Philoxenus has overheard the preceding remarks of Mnesilochus, who
is subsequently referred to by illie, illum until he has been accosted by Philoxenus, when
Lydus (v. 454) uses ltu-‚- see Amph. vv. 288, 290. Or else the old man expresses his
astonishment by hie when he sees Mnes. for the first time, and then uses illie until
the latter has been brought into the conversation, for up to this point he has been
speaking aside or to the audience. Mnesilochus has no reason to be afraid of the
pedagogue seeing him, but from the conversation that he has overheard he fears that
his young friend has got into trouble on his account, and therefore does not wish to be
seen by the father about the house of the sister. Mnes. is afraid that the father may
not be propitious to his undertaking, for from what he has heard he knows him to
be the father of Pist.; v. 447 shows that he is of opinion that Pist. is well able to
manage the pedagogue, therefore he has nothing to fear from that quarter. And in fact
neither Lydus nor the old man knows anyt-hing of the res mandata, for the former holds
up the conduct of Mnesilochus as a model worthy the imitation of Pistoclerus, and draws
the old inan's attention (v. 489) to Mncs’. grief at the misconduct of his son. All three
arc kept as yet in ignorance about the real state. of matters. I have no doubt, therefore,
that illum in the text refers to Philoxenus.

450. inim cp. v. 135. Pistoclevi; R.,Fleck.‚and L'ss. condemn this reading3
as they have nothing to substitute but conjectures, I gladly follow the MSS. and W.;
[sss. omits pist„ leaving the v. incoinplete.

451. ille, of course, refers to the absent Pist.‚ although just mentioned. lupanavh
forfarrzir, from lupa for meretrix: cp. Juv. vi. 121 ; Quint. v. 10, 39.

452. produxi& for (senuit..- cp. Ter.‚ Ad. iii. 2, 16.
453. Saluos sis; for salue: cp. v. 537; Stich. 316.

454. enim ; see n. vv. 48 and 699. The last part of this v. expresses almost the
same thought as that of v. 452. Ρίῒθς “in due time,'’ or some expression with similar
force. productust; with same meaning as above.

455. ln mare it; ep. Truc. ii. 7, 15; “he goes to sea,” almost equivalent to
inssi-mlitur marn, but different from nae-z'yat. which means ‘⁴ he is at sea”; see Ter„ Hec.
iii. 4, 3, 5. Nearly the sanie sentiment is found in Psalm cvii. 23, English Bible, “They
that go down to the sca in ships.'’ iit of B (Uss., ut Goetz) or ut of OD might have
been put in the text ; the latter would give, perhaps, better sense than the former; as all
