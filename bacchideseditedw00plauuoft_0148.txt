88 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

2527, are the words of Bacchis, addressed to the sister. Philargyrius, commenting
on ‘⁴ taurinis follibus,'' Virg, Georg. iv. 171, quotes this fragment, giving, however,
‘⁶ habent‚’‘ while Priscian gives “ habeant.'' halitant is an emendation of Hermann.
This word is found in a fragment of Ennius, and must be taken transitively with quem
supplied as object. quom; relative adverb of time, generally with indicative in this
sense in Plautus; see vv. 57, 301, 355-6, 534; Α111. 176; Α111Ρ11.»661, 746, 858, 115ος
Capt. 216, 282, 4223 Most. v. 2, 53, 97, 162; Men. 29; Merc. iii. 1, 243 iii. 4, 31;
Pers. v. 2, 58; Stich. 511; Trin. 194, 242, 492; Pseud. 804, 823, 907, 990. ubi;
relative adverb of place; cp. Amph. 200, 1096. quoiatiszq1‹01·as; both forms are
used in nom. sing. mas. or fem.:cuia³, an interrogative pronoun, adj„ formed from
gen. sing. of quis, “of what nation,” often found in old writers. “Cujatis esset⁷'
(Attius). R. assigns the word to Pistoclerus as if questioning a slave; Bacchis appears
to put the question to the sister; see Poen., Prol. 109; v. 2, 33, 34; Men. ii. 2, 66;
Curc. 407.

28. R. gives this line to a slave, but Uss. considers it the sister‘s reply to Bacchis.
The poet ridicules the people of Praeneste, a town of Latium, situated away among the
mountains at a distance of more than twenty miles from Rome, and inaccessible to the
higher civilization of her people. It enjoyed and maintained a great degree of 111-
dependence, and for this reason the Praenestine folk were not very popular at Rome.
Plautus also shows up their rustic dialect ; his characters, however, being Greeks, other
old Latin towns are often exposed to their raillery. In connection with what has been
said see Capt. 882; Trin. 609; Τ1110. 111. 2, 23. ορίηο; used by Plautus and Ennius
for opinor; see Trin. 422; Stich. 29ος Pseud. 873 Epid. ii. 2, 76. ita; adv. with a
demonstrative force, referring back to Praenestinum:Praenestinorum modo; not:
tam with adj., which is stronger; ita is only used in this way with an adj. in a
few negative phrases. Plautus merely makes the sister say that, being in her opinion
a native of Praeneste, the soldier is like them, a fact which is well known, full
of glory or boastful. gloriosus cp. Curc. 471, 633; Miles 87, 89; Pseud. 794;
Epid. ii. 2, 118. Arabo& R. writes Arabus, nom. sing.; Ι have, with Uss., put the
former in the text. Charisius quotes Poen. v. 4, 9 111 his comments on Aen. vii. 605,
where the word occurs. The common reading in Poen. is Arabius.

30. mercedem annuam; for the meaning see As. 228, 233, 7473 Truc. ii.
4, 58. R. gives this and following line to the soldier, Cleomachus. They are evidently
spoken by Bacchis to the sister, for it is difficult to see how, if the soldier be the
speaker, he could apply the reflexive pronoun of the third pers. to himself, the first.

31. ab se. The proposition has the three forms, α, ab, ahs, of which the last is
the oldest, and derived from the same root as ἄψ, ἀπὸ. Plautus uses the last form,
but in Cicero we have it only in combination with te, abs te, whilst in the rest of the
classical writers it is rarely‚ if ever, met with; see vv. 1021, 1142, 1169; Stich. 255,
508, 514, 548; Cure. 174, 619; Pseud. 43, 320, 486, 509, 916, 1316; Trin. 421, 695,
947, 969, 1143-44, 1167, Most. iii. 1, 1203 iv. 2, 21; Amph. 736; Miles 1126, Men.
iv. 2, 77; Aul. 219; Το1·., Ρ1101·111. 11. 3, 31. Ab can be used both before vowels and
consonants, but it is curious to observe that in this linc we have ab, whilst in the
preceding the proposition is a, although a consonant follows in both cases. We find ab
often before s, seldom before a labial. The vowel in this word is short by nature, and
it is always treated so by Plautus, for we even find α short; see Trin. 969 above. Very
