COMMENTARY AND NOTES. 85

Vv. 8, 9, and 10 are given by Uss. to Bacchis. Goetz says, “Sed vix probabile
versus spectare ad militem.''

8. lenocinium facer’e; to ply the trade 01 a pander, notzstuprwn ‘fac-cre, as
Ritschl thinks; cp. Epid. iv. 2, 11 ; Mero. ii. 3, 75.

9. Videas (illud); Hortat. conjunc.; cp. Capt. 42Ο; 55 to the mood of the
verb 01 1110 dependent clause, see Madv. G. L. 356, obs. 33 and cp. vv. 76, 200, 554

Stich. 4103 As. 27, 148, 227, 293, 875.

10. istac aetate. These words could scarcely be addressed to the sister; cp. vv.
340, 1086, 1096, 1135, 1162; Miles 618, 622, 626; Amph. 1025; Most. i. 3, 39, 44;
Trin. 367, 1190; Cas. ii. 3, 26, 43; iii. 1, 4. secter& cp. Pers. ii. 1, 5. gratiis;
“for nothing”; cp. Capt. 408.

11. Instead 01 11115 11110 Ritschl gives one 110111 Servius ad Virg. (Bucol. viii. 71),
“Nam tu quidem cuiuis excantare 001· facile potes,” but assigns it to Bacchis, as 11
addressed to the sister. Nam, an old form of enim, gives a cause 01· 01105 511 instance
to affirm or deny a previous statement, which is often 10 be supplied from the context.
(You do not require my services, for you are able, I should think, &ci excantar’e;
“to draw out by a charin, to enchant.’' This is a rare word, and not used elsewhere,
as 151· 55 Ι know, by the Comic writers. Seneca has it; see Quaestiones Naturales 4, 7.

12. ingenium ; “ natural quality or disposition, talents, parts3 acuteneSS,” 55 11010.
in anirn03 animus is the principle 01 rational 1110 55 opposed 10 mens, the thinking
faculty, and to anima the life-giving principle, the soul, the mind. For animus, anima,
cp. v. 864; Trin. 1091-923 101· animus, mem, Cist. ii. 1, 73 Epid. iv. 1, 5; Trin. 454;
and see vv. 491, 507; Cic., Rep. ii. 40; de Senect. 11; Tusc. iii. 5; Ter„ And. 137.
“ Sapimus animo, fruimur anima; sine animo anima est debilis'⁷ (Attius, Epigoni).
utibiie; Plautine 110111Ξ1αἱῐι1 : see Mero. v. 4, 45; Miles 613; Most. iv. 1, 2; Τ1111.
748; Μο11. v. 6, 2ος Ter„ Phorm. iv. 4, 9. modicum ; cp. Pseud. 1228; Curc. 103;
Trin. 831; “ moderate, modest.” uer‘niiitate; from uerna, “cringing civility, without
pertness.’' Caecilius has “nimis tandem hoc fit uerniliter.'’

13. limaces vivi. Ritschl assigns these words to the soldier, as if he were
inveighing against the sisters and their class, but the latter word cannot be applied to
them3 it may, however, be taken as a genitive sing. Of course limas-es would be very
appropriate applied to the sisters. The position 01 riri would not justify both being
taken as nouns and in nom. pl.‚ except that the former might be 001151111οᾶ 55
an adj., ‘⁴ snail-men.'‘ Pistoclerus is soliloquizing about the business he has
undertaken. He requires assistance, the character 01 which he has stated in the
preceding verse, but he cannot employ “the snails 01 a man‚” viz„ the parasites who
crawl about, cringe, and defile those on whom they fasten, he is only supposing his
own case, if obliged to make use of them, and uses the sing. R. cites a line from Plautus
quoted by Varro in support of his view, “limaces‚ liuidae, diobolares, schoeniculae,
miraculae,’' supposed to be from the lost play, Neri-daria. Ussing says this word is
derived from lima. An important, 11 not the most important, factor in derivationis
the meaning, but in these two words any bond 01 meaning between them seems to me to
