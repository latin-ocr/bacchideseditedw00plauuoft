triginta annis. The young men were far from thirty—we see that Pist. is still under
the charge of a pedagogue. The slave exaggerates3 and while he says that their ages
are nearly the same, implies that one is a mere boy in natural ability, the other a man
of mature years. triqinta was probably suggested by triduum preced. v.—“ He is the
senior of the other in natural ability by more than thirty years.” maiust ; in MSS„
which W. and Goetz have retained; all others have alteris-t without any authority, and
for what reason I do not know. Both parts of the compar-ison have here the same
subject and predicate; the complements are different3 the common verb or its comple-
ment may be omitted in the one part and supplied from the other, but not both, as
would be the case were the emend. adopted. The peculiarity of this v. seems to arise
from the fact that there are two comparatives. quam, of course, does not require to be
expressed after plus, but it must be here after maius. The effect of putting the verb in
the quam clause would be to leave the comparative or first clause without either verb or
complement; therefore it is much better to keep the verb in first clause, as it is in the
MSS„ with ei or hnic to be supplied as compIement, and to let it be supplied in quam
clause, with alteri expressed as complement. Both complements are in the same case
and belong to the same verb. Ι need not say that sense and grammar are entirely in
favour of the MS. reading.

460. This and following v. have been removed from their place in the MSS. in
the text of Ussing, and put after the next two, on the plea of want of connexion wit-h
what precedes and what follows. Guyet, R„ Ribbeck, and Fleck. have separated this
and the three succeeding vv„ which are clearly connected both in language and sense.
Ussing’s change is the least objectionable, but it fails to obviate the difficulty, and
rather, as far as Ι can see, increases it. I have therefore retained the order of the
MSS„ which is also that of W. and Goetz. Caue malum; “beware of mischief‚”
trouble, or punishment; cp. Cas. iv. 4, 173 Miles 279, 531, 547, 861; Amph, Prol.
31 ; As. 30, 43 ; Cio„ de Orat. i. 58, 247. The verb is used in this sense with an accus.
by Cicero, Caesar, and Horace; most editors write malo: Uss. and Goetz as in the
text; also, the phrase caue canem shows that with the sense here, with accus„ it was in
general use. Also see Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum v., N 0. 8110, Ca rem malum, si non.

accus.; see n. v. 156, and cp. Most. v. 2, 51 ; Ter.‚ Hec. iii. 1, 2 ; Hor., Carni. ii. 12, 23;
Ov.‚ Trist. iii. 3, 51. In poetry sometimes, and occasionally in prose, we find an infinitive
used for the supines, and for all cases of the gerund, and, especially in both, with four or
five verbs in a peculiar construction for accus. of gerund depending on a verb; see Hor„
Epis. 1. 19, 9; Juv.‚ Sat. vii. 150. Mr. Roby, I believe, is right in stating that the
