124 PLAUTI BACCHIDES.

296. Quoniam, is given as the reading in D. qu& is the reading in C which,
Ι believe, has been written by someonc for ‘1²²3‘ an abbreviation of quando, often found
in MSS. In vv. 237, 239 quoniam has a sort of causal sense, but here there is no
change of subject or tense between the two verbs, and the latter has cuminum besides,
the reference to time is emphasized by quanda», and the effect of variety, so important in
comedy, ought not to be overlooked. On the whole, I would prefer the latter. With
regard to the quantity of the final vowel if quando is read, it is long in Virg.‚ Hor„ and
Ovid; short in later poets. It is long in Men. ii. 3, 73; iv. 2, 106; Amph. 857, 965;
Trin. 1131, and v. 221 above ; and there is no doubt that the vowel was originally long.
With sense here cp. v. 221; Amph. 857; Men. ii. 1, 45; iii. 3, 23; v. 2, 81; v. 5,
273 Most. iii. 1, 1563 Merc. 1. 2, 60; Pseud. 258. These references are given on the
supposition that the reading is Quando but being unwilling to change, as little can be
gained by doing so, I have followed the other editors and retained Quoniam.

297. continuo3 see n. v. 258. Postridie (Posti-vidie). Notice the alliteration
in first part of this v.

298. Αυΐθνὶῐηυ8; pres. hist. This verb is constructed in Plautus in this sense
with accus. and al» with abl.; sometimes the abl. is omitted, the sense not requiring
its expression3 iuis praesentibus, therefore, is not abl. after ausen, for Plautus
employs the preposition, nor dat„ which has a different sense, but abl. abs, ; cp. v. 333;
Nepos, Hann. ix. 3. The rule that a subst. or pronoun cannot be employed in the abl.
clause and a pronoun in another part of the sentence, when they stand for the same
person or thing in both, appears to be here violated, for inis and ἰΙΙί (next v.) are put
for the host and the robbers. Exceptions, however, can be found even in the best
writers3 cp. v. 416; Cio„ Phil. xi. 103 Caes. vii. 43 Sall.,Jug. 14; Liv. xxxviii. 54;
Juv. xiii. 3.

299. Paiam; “openly,’' opp. to clam; cp. v. 330; Aul. 268, 275, 7213 Amph.
869 ; Capt. 223 ; Merc. v. 4, 63; Poen., Prol. 126 ; Truc. iv. 3, 77 ; Trin. 143. apevte;
“piiblicly,'‘ opp. to OCCHZIU; cp. Cio„ Or. 12, Agr. i. 1. ut ini id factum sciscer’ent3
“that they might ascertain it had taken place''; cp. Amph. 1035. factunm particip.

300. Scite heroli& “cleverly done,’‘ sc. ιῐαεΐιιηι, “upon my word‘'; cp. Cas. iii.
1, 8, 11; Merc. iii. 1, 28; Miles 1066; Stich. 2733 Trin. 783, 786, 1147. hercle3 see
n. v. 208. Ced0; “pray.’' ilico; see n. v. 7.

301. Quom; sec n. vv. 25-7. Quom extempflm cp. Capt. 433, 780; Most. i.
2, 18; Merc. ii. 2, 243 Pseud. 804; Trin. 241, 492, 725. This scene, down to 345,
might be compared with that between Hecuba and Polymestor (Eurip., Hec. 968, &c.),
and even the former part of it seems to resemble it.

302. lembum; sce n. v. 276. capitibus quassantibus; abl. of manner;
quas-s, intrans. Tossing their heads in indignation; cp. As. 400; Merc. iii. 4, 15. Uss-
quotes Caecilius, “ Sic quassante capite tristes incedunt.‘'

303. deposuimus; ‹l‹7›(›si‹·z'nr1cs, emend. of Acidal., has been adopted by W.‚ R„
Fleck„ and Uss. ; Gronov„ Bothe and the MSS. have the reading in the text. The only
thing in favour of the emend. is that it preserves the accent and prevents hiatus. The
change in this instance is easy, and perhaps makes a better line; it does not, however,
follow that the MSS'. are at fault. The effect of hiatus is destroyed hythe caesura, and
