PLAUTUS. xiii

clusive. For this he writesz-‘I do not despise the Comedies of Terence, but as
Phoebus far surpasses the rest of the heavenly bodies in brilliancy, in the same way
Plautus far surpasses Terence in his use of the Latin tongue. For whatever wit and
humour one may find in the latter, has been entirely drawn from the workshop of
Plautus. Wherefore, not undeservedly, Terence earned the name of ‘Plautus’ Ape.’⁷'
J. Lipsius, likewise‚ a man by far the most important in all scholarship, says, “l even
love Terence, but Plautus Ι admire more. Let both be in the lap, the hands, and
before the eyes of youth. Let them also, if desirable‚ be compared with each other,
only Terence must not be preferred to Plautus.” Volcatius Sedigitus assigns the second
place among the Comic poets to the latter, and the sixth to the former—

Plautus secundus facile exsuperat ceteros.

In sexto sequitur hos loco Terentius.

(7) It is well known that Horace was a rather severe critic of the old poets, and
especially of Plautus. Pareus says:—“There are, however, some who grate upon my
ears, and who, relying on a sort of daring‚ strive by their jests to lessen and depreciate,
not only in words but in reality, the praise of Plautus. And these are either old or
more recent. Among the old despisers of Plautus, Horatius Flaccus is at the head of
the band who, whether seriously or in jest, blubbered out against Plautus such a jeer as
this.'' After quoting 270-74 of his Ars Pcetz'ca our critic proceeds:—“Behold, Horace
sprang up, the leader of all the detractors of Plautus, from whose school, as if from the
Trojan horse, an innumerable swarm of scoffers issued. From it came another noisy
gabbler, the famous Terentian Aristarchus, who was not ashamed, audaciorisly‚ not to
use a stronger term, to proclaim such words as these against Plautus ;-Ηαι“ι1 Plautina
sunt, says 110, cum in <iisdem longua sit disputatio, sed mire α Terentio ad ejzts mremplmn, et,
quod est plus, carent Plautinis nassis, “Of these more recent detractors, a sort of a
Minturnian chimes in, who discoursed very strongly and insipidly, that many insipid
expressions are found in our Plautus. But what shall we do‘? Shall we therefore
patiently suffer these daily charges to be made against Plautus? By no means. We
must jeer in turn at these shallow-pated and unscrupulous Zoili, in order that they may
begin to recant when perceiving that they have been trying to seize a grasshopper by
the wing. But that Ι may not be more tedicus than is necessary, nor get into a greater
passion than is right, I shall refute that opinion of Horace with, as I hope, plausible
