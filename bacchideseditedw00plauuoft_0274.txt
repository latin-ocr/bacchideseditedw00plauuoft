1195. This and two following vv. are given to Phil. by R. and Flock. and some of
the old editors; Fleck. and Goetz omit uenit. The last-named and W. give the verses
to Bacchis. W. and Uss. retain uenit. uenit in mentem; with infin.; cp. Cic.‚
Fam. iv. 10; xii. 1; 1110 verb here must be present tense. amabo ; see n. v. 42. dum ;

1196. lam; Uss. with Bothe and Goetz writes Tam, and says that “Iam sensu

330; Virg, Aen. vi. 371. euenturum3 agreeing with 1100. esse; depend. on uenit
in mentem, v. 1195. This and two preced. vv. may be translated, “ Does it not occur to
you, pray, if you were 10 enjoy yourself as long as you live, that now in troth this will
not indeed be very long, and that if you 101 11113 present opportunity pass it will never
return to you afterwards when you are dead ’'5> With regard to amabo in v. 1195, Uss.
mentions in his 11010 111111 Seyffert holds that it cannot be addressed by one man to
another, but in three instances at least in Plautus this is not so, 1'.‹’.‚ As. 700; Most.
ii. 1, 383 ii. 2, 36. 111 any caso this would not apply here.

1198. Quid ago f> “What am I to do’'‘? subj. might be expected here as in 1191,

metuis ἓ) “ What are you afraid of’'‘? metuere is employed here just as in the dialogue

vv. 51-3, 63, 76, 90.

1199. obnoxius; submissive, obliged or under an obligation, and therefore expected

216; Miles 746; Trin. 269, 1063-4; Ter„ 1100. 111. 1, 22; also Virg„ Geor. i. 396; ii.
