METRES AND PROSODY. xlvii

(V. 1194.) “Te amabo et te amplexabor. Nic. Caput prurit3 perii; uix negito’';
Capm, follows the rule.

(V. 1196.) “Iam pol id quidem esse haud perlonginquom'’; tl, with the rule;
esse, rule holds good.

(V. 1197.) “Neque si 1100 hodie amiseris, post in mort-e euenturum esse l'lnquanl?’'
amiseris, with the rule.

(V. 1204.) “Satin ego istuc habeo offirmatum‘? Nic. Quod semel dixi’'; istuc,
with the rule; semel, follows the rule.

(V. 1206.) “Filii 1103 expectant intus. Nic. Quam quidem actutum emori2i1nur”;
Quam, the rule fails.

(V. 1207.) “Vesper 1110 631; sequimini. Phil. Ducite nos, quo lubet, tamquam
quidem addictos; lubet, with the rule; addictos, follows the rule.

(9) Thus it will be seen that a greater number of these shortenings occurs in the
Anapaestic verses than in any of the 011161· 11161163, viz„ 55 in 104 verses in that
Metre found in this Comedy, and that in them the rule is better complied 111111, there
being only four exceptions. In the other Metres noted above, amount-ing to about
160 verses, 24 cases have been found, to 9 of which the rule cannot be applied.

In the Senary verses, then, there are the 1611631 shortenings, and 111111 the exception
of the Anapaests the rule holds better than in any of the other Metres. We have therefore
200 03363 in all in this Comedy, and in 39 of these the rule fails. Assigning an equal
number to each of the other Comedies, 116 would have 4000 cases, of 11111011 31111031 800,
01· 3 fifth part, the rule 13113 10 explain.

We might here conclude our 1611611 01 1116 Metres 01 11113 Comedy vvere it not 11131
301116 011161· important matters require to be noticed. And the first is a question
that often presents itself, 11Ζ., How far 1133 the Latin language capable 01 being
employed in the composition of Iambic verse? This might seem 3 frivolous question
were it not 101· 1116 1301 11131 we are reminded continually by writers on the Metres of
Plautus, and by the editors of his Comedies, 01 1116 Trochaic 01· 8Ρο11(1310 rhythm of 1116
Latin 10113116,11111011 11163113, 116 suppose, that it is ill adapted 101· 1116 composition of
Iambic verses. This may be so, but Donaldson, in his Appendix on the Metres and
Prosody 01 1116 Greek Dramatists in the ·’·’ Τ116311·6 01 the Greeks,’⁷ says exaetly the same
thing 01 lambio Trimeters in general, and he is speaking particularly 01 Greek Iambic
Verse. If this be correct, then lambio Trimeters in Greek and the Latin 8611311113
are Γ1110011310 111 rhythm. The Latin language is said, 116 suppose, to be Troehaic in its
rhythm because no Latin word, 111111 1116 exception 01 monosyllables, is accented on the
last syllable; but this does not apply to Greek; therefore Greek and Latin Iambic Tri-
meters cannot both be Trochaic for the same reason. However this may be, Aristotle
tells us, in the fourth chapter of 1113 ··Poetics,’' 11131 1116 Iambic measure is most of all
adapted 10 dialogue and conversational or familiar discourse in Greek, and as the Latins
adopted the Greek metres this, 116 would suppose, holds good also in Latin poetry.

If these views of the authorities mentioned be correct, one would expect 3 larger
number of Spondees and Dactyls in Trochaic metres than in Iambie, for these feet have
3 Trochaic rhythm; but this is not so, for the general practice of Aristophanes in Greek
(this, at least, holds in Aristophanes 33 regards Spondees) and of Plautus and Terence in
Latin unmistakably demonstrates the fact that 3 11111011 larger number—more especially
of Spondees—of these feet is found in Iambic Trimeters than in Trochaic Tetrameters,
